            Year Animal Astrology<br />
        </strong><span>
            At Chinese New Year
            you hear about the animal sign that is going to rule the year ahead. Babies
            born in that year are said to be born under that animal sign. Personality and
            luck are influenced by the energies of the year animal sign. There are a total
            of twelve different animal signs. Year Animal Astrology is a simple form of
            Chinese Astrology based on a cycle of twelve years. The same cycle of twelve
            animals also rule months, days and double hours (the twenty four hours in the
            day are divided into units of two hours). The twelve animals are pseudonyms for
            the twelve earthly branches, and time is measured with the twelve earthly
            branches together with the ten heavenly stems.

            Four Pillars of Destiny (Bazi)<br />
        </strong><span>
            There is far more to
            Chinese Astrology than your year animal sign. The heavenly stems and earthly
            branches form a cycle of sixty pillars. A pillar is a unit of time written vertically,
            with the name of the heavenly stem above the name of the earthly branch. When a
            baby is born you can write out the date and time of birth as four pillars: a
            year pillar, month pillar, day pillar and hour pillar. These four pillars become
            part of a chart for the method of Chinese Astrology known as the Four Pillars
            of Destiny. The Four Pillars gives you a far more personalized picture of your innate
            characteristics and luck than your animal sign. An experienced astrologer can
            analyze and interpret the Four Pillars chart to give a life reading. Learning
            the art of life readings using the Four Pillars is complex, and it can take
            years of practice to become highly competent.

            There is the simple
            Year Animal Astrology and there is the rather more sophisticated Four Pillars
            of Destiny. The question remains, what is Chinese Destiny Star Astrology?
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        Chinese Destiny Star Astrology is
        another name for the Master Ghost Valley system of life reading. We have
        translated the ancient Chinese poetry classic known as "Ghost Valley Art
        of Life Reading" (鬼谷子算命術 Gui Gu Zi Suan Ming Shu) into English and packaged it in this app
        together with our free Four Pillars Calculator.

        <strong>
            How to Use the Four Pillars Calculator<br />
        </strong><span>
            We plot a Four Pillars
            chart using solar time. To plot a chart you need to know:
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        a) a
        person&#8217;s date, time and place of birth;<br />
        <span>
            b) the
            timezone and longitude of the birth place;<br />
        </span><span>
            c) if
            daylight saving time was in use at time of birth.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            The Four Pillars
            Calculator has a number of buttons:
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>Select from map</strong><span>
            &#8211; Finds the timezone and longitude
            of anywhere in the world. You can pan and zoom on the map to find your birth
            place then tap to mark the location.<br />
        </span><strong>Set from current position &#8211; </strong><span>
            sets the timezone and longitude for
            the location where you are at the moment. Handy if you happen to be in your
            town of birth when using the app.<br />
        </span><strong>Save - </strong><span>
            saves a record of the birth details you have
            entered.<br />

    <p>
        <span>
            You can use the Four
            Pillars Calculator online or offline. You need to be online to get the timezone
            and longitude from the map, or to set it from your current position. If you use
            the app offline you can select the timezone and enter the longitude.&nbsp; Longitude is expressed as a number of degrees
            east or a number of degrees west. When you input the longitude figure into the
            calculator, longitudes which are west are entered with a minus sign in front of
            the number of degrees. For example New York, NY, USA has a longitude of 74W,
            therefore you would enter -74 into the box for longitude. If the birth place is
            at a longitude which is east, you just enter the number of degrees.

        </strong><span>
            With Chinese Destiny
            Star Astrology (&#8220;Destiny Stars&#8221;) you do not need to study a Four Pillars chart
            in detail in order to obtain a life reading. You still plot the Four Pillars,
            and you can use our Four Pillars Calculator to that quickly and accurately. Our
            Four Pillars Calculator is a little different from the other Four Pillars
            calculators in that it is programmed with the Master Ghost Valley system. The
            Master Ghost Valley system uses the year pillar and hour pillar to obtain the
            Numerals and Stars.

            In Year Animal
            Astrology your luck is influenced by one animal sign. You could say it is quite
            general as it predicts that everyone born in the same year will have the same
            luck at the same time. In the Four Pillars Astrology you get a far more
            personalized reading because the influences of the year, month, day and hour
            are studied, but you need to know how to interpret a Four Pillars chart, or
            consult an astrologer to read your chart.&nbsp;
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            The life readings in
            Chinese Destiny Stars Astrology are &#8216;done for you&#8217; readings. There is no need
            to analyze all the intricacies of the Four Pillars, yet you get a more
            individual reading than you would from one of the twelve animal signs. &nbsp;
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            With Chinese Destiny
            Star Astrology you have a poetic life reading from:
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        1) A
        Year Star (free with this app)<br />
        <span>
            2) A
            Numeral (in-app purchase)<br />
        </span><span>
            3) An
            Hour Star (included in the in-app purchase for the Numeral)<br />
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            Not only were you born
            under the auspices of a year animal sign, you have two stars shining on your
            life and a Numeral predicting your fate and fortune.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <span>
            You can get your brief
            Year Star reading for free. After you have input your birth details into the
            Four Pillars Calculator press the Year Star button.
        </span>

    <p>
        <span>
            If you want to know more
            about what Master Ghost Valley says about your luck you can purchase the life reading
            for an individual Numeral (your Hour Star reading is included in the Numeral
            life reading), or you can purchase the entire set of one hundred life readings
            straight away. If you buy the complete set of life readings for 100 Numerals in
            one bundle then that works out to be better value than buying all of the 100
            life readings one at a time. If you treat yourself to our bundle offer of the
            complete set of one hundred life readings, you can find the stars and numerals
            for your friends and family. You can even input birth information of famous
            people to see what sort of luck your favorite celebrities will be facing. &nbsp;&nbsp;

            Interpreting the Life Readings<br />
        </strong><span>
            Many centuries ago the
            genius Master Ghost Valley devised his system of stars and numerals with life
            readings encoded in beautifully written Chinese poetry. We have taken the
            Chinese poems contained in the &#8220;Ghost Valley&#8221; book and re-written them as poems
            in English to give a flavor of the cryptic nuances contained in the original
            and interpreted the poems as predictions for a life reading. Throughout the
            ages it was difficult for people to fully understand the content of the poems
            written by Master Ghost Valley. To make it easier for you we have included &#8220;Notes
            on Interpretation&#8221;, and &#8220;Symbolism and Historic References&#8221; to explain how the
            readings relevant to today&#8217;s modern lifestyle. You can access the information
            to help you understand the readings when you carry out an in-app purchase.
        </span>
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>
            Birth Time Not Known<br />
        </strong><span>
            What if you are not
            certain about your time of birth? Can you still get a life reading from a
            Numeral? Yes!
        </span><span>&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        When you do not know
        your hour of birth you can check ten possible readings, to see which reading
        best fits your life.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, if you
        have a year of birth ending in the digit 4, e.g 1944, 1954, 1964, 1974, 1984,
        1994,&#8230;..then your life reading will be one of the Numerals in the range of from
        1 to 10. By studying all ten life readings you can see if you might be able to
        figure out which Numeral makes the most sense to you.<span>&nbsp;</span>
    </p>
    <p>
        If your birthday falls
        on and between January 1<sup>st</sup> and February 3<sup>rd</sup> then you need
        to take the previous year as your birth year. For example, somebody born on the
        20<sup>th</sup> January 1988 would take 1987 as the birth year.
    </p>
    <p>
        Here is a table
        showing you the range of Numerals you can search through to find your life reading
        when you do not have clear information on your time of birth.
