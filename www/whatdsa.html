            Are you curious about Chinese Destiny Stars Astrology? Is it like the Chinese zodiac with the twelve year animals? In Chinese year animal astrology there is an animal sign for your birth year. In Chinese Destiny Stars Astrology there is a Year Star for your birth year, similar idea to the year animal, and there is more. You also have a Destiny Numeral and an hour star. Your Destiny Numeral gives you a life reading. Where do these life readings come from? They come from an ancient Chinese book known as "Ghost Valley Art of Life Reading" (鬼谷子算命術 Gui Gu Zi Suan Ming Shu) by Master Ghost Valley. We have translated the Ghost Valley book, which was written in classical Chinese poetry into poems in English. The luck verses which make up a life reading talk about your character, career, marriage, children and general luck in life.

            You get the brief Year Star reading for free. You make in-app purchases of the life readings individually or you can purchase the entire set of one hundred life readings in one bundle (better value than buying all of the 100 life readings one at a time). If you treat yourself to the complete set of one hundred life readings, you can find out what is in the Destiny Stars and Numerals for your friends and family, or for just about anyone.
            Do you want to know what Master Ghost Valley predicted for you? To get your life reading you need to find your Destiny Numeral from the free Four Pillars Calculator.

        <h3>How to Use the Four Pillars Calculator</h3>
        <div>
            <p class="title"></p>
            <p class="contents">
                The Four Pillars Calculator automatically works out a birth chart for your Four Pillars of Destiny (aka Ba zi). We plot a Four Pillars chart using solar time. This means we use the start of the solar year, which usually falls on February 4th each year. Chinese New Year celebrations take place at the start of the lunar year, so Chinese year animal signs often use the lunar year (which starts on a date from January 20th to February 20th).
                <br>
                <br>
                To plot a chart you need to know:
                <br>
                <br>
                a)  a person’s date, time and place of birth.
                <br>
                 b)  the timezone and longitude of the birth place.
                <br>
                c)  if daylight saving time was in use at the time of birth.
                <br>
                <br>
                The Four Pillars Calculator has instructions on the screen and you can also watch the video on the support page of our website www.fengshuiapps.com.
                <br>
                You can use the Four Pillars Calculator online or offline. You need to be online to get the timezone and longitude from the map, or to set it from your current position. If you use the app offline you can select the timezone and enter the longitude.  When you input the longitude figure into the calculator, longitudes which are west are entered with a minus sign in front of the number of degrees. For example New York, NY, USA has a longitude of 74W, therefore you would enter -74 into the box for longitude. If the birth place is at a longitude which is east, you just enter the number.

        <h3>‘Done for You’ Life Readings</h3>

            <p class="contents">
                The mysterious Master Ghost Valley wrote in a cryptic style, so as well as translating the luck verses, we have added some commentaries to each of the Destiny Numeral Life Readings. In addition, you can tap to read “Notes on Interpretation”, and “Symbolism and Historic References” from any of the life readings. There could be alternative interpretations to the conclusions we have drawn in the commentaries and we would love to hear your ideas. You can get in touch with us via our website: www.fengshuiapps.com or our Facebook page: <a href='http://www.facebook.com/ChineseAstrologyApp'>www.facebook.com/ChineseAstrologyApp.</a>

        <h3>Birth Time Not Known</h3>

                What if you are not certain about your time of birth? Can you still get a life reading from a Numeral? Yes!
                <br><br>
                When you do not know your hour of birth you can check ten possible readings, to see which reading best fits your life.
                For example, if you have a year of birth ending in the digit 4, e.g 1944, 1954, 1964, 1974, 1984, 1994,…..then your life reading will be one of the Numerals in the range of from 1 to 10. By studying all ten life readings you can see if you might be able to figure out which Numeral makes the most sense to you.
                <br><br>
                If your birthday falls on and between January 1st and February 3rd then you need to take the previous year as your birth year. For example, somebody born on the 20th January 1988 would take 1987 as the birth year.
                <br><br>
                Here is a table showing you the range of Numerals you can search through to find your life reading when you do not have clear information on your time of birth.
