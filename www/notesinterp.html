  <p><strong>Notes
    on Interpretation</strong></p>
  <p>Now that you have found your Destiny
    Numeral based on the Master Ghost Valley system you have a life reading in a
    slightly cryptic format. As you can see each life reading comprises of Numeral,
    Hexagram, Stars, Destiny, Luck Verses (Foundation, Life Path, Marriage,
    Children and Harvest) and Style.</p>
  <p><strong>The
    Numerals</strong></p>
  <p>Let&#8217;s begin with the <strong>Destiny Numeral</strong>. There are a hundred numerals. Each numeral is
    named according to the Chinese names of the heavenly stems for your year of
    birth and your hour of birth. For example, Numeral 8 Jia Xin is the eighth out
    of one hundred life readings. Jia refers to the heavenly stem of the year of
    birth and Xin refers to the heavenly stem of the hour of birth.</p>
  <p><strong>The
    Hexagrams</strong></p>
  <p>Each numeral is linked to a <strong>Hexagram</strong> from the I Ching (Yi Jing).
    There are 100 numerals in the Master Ghost Valley system and 64 hexagrams in
    the I Ching. This means some hexagrams appear under more than one numeral. The
    original text does not offer any interpretations of the hexagrams and we leave
    it up to you to see what you might discover from various other sources. You
    might find it interesting to study the relationship between the numerals,
    heavenly stems and hexagrams.</p>
  <p><strong>The
    Stars </strong></p>
  <p>The star names are translated from Chinese
    in the original Master Ghost Valley manuscript to English. The stars are not
    related to actual stars in the sky. How Master Ghost Valley came up with the
    star names remains a mystery.</p>
  <p>Each person was born under the auspices of
    two stars: a year star and an hour star. Some stars serve as both year stars
    and hour stars. Most of the stars serve only as hour stars.</p>
  <p>You can easily find out your year star and
    the brief reading according to the year star by pressing the year star button
    on the Four Pillars Calculator. Your year star is not connected to your Destiny
    Numeral, but your hour star is linked to your Numeral. We are now going to talk
    about how you can find your hour star </p>
  <p>For each numeral there are three possible
    stars. You find your personal hour star out of the three possibilities by
    looking for your hour animal in the tables. Remember your hour pillar was
    calculated using the Four Pillars Calculator.</p>
  <p>Let&#8217;s illustrate how to find your hour star
    using your hour pillar based on the example of Numeral 3.</p>
  <p><strong>Numeral 3 Jia Bing</strong></p>
  <p>The first star is the Heavenly Obstacle
    Star and this is the star for somebody born in either Rat hour or Tiger hour.
    In the table where it says Hour Pillar, if you read across it gives Bing Zi &#8211;
    Fire Rat and Bing Yin &#8211; Fire Tiger.
    Somebody with Destiny Numeral 3 born in Rat hour would take the reading
    from the metaphor and explanation from the column under Bing Zi &#8211; Fire Rat,
    whereas somebody born in Tiger hour would take the reading from under Bing Yin
    &#8211; Fire Tiger. The same star covers two
    different hour pillars and gives a different reading for each hour pillar.</p>

  <p>Now that we have explained how to find the
    Destiny Star under a numeral, let&#8217;s take a look at what is in the rest of the
    life reading.</p>
  <p><strong>Destiny</strong></p>
  <p>This is a translation of the prose from Master
    Ghost Valley about someone&#8217;s fate and fortune according to the portents of the
    numeral.</p>
  <p><strong>Luck
    Verses </strong>(Foundation, Life Path, Marriage, Children
    and Harvest)</p>
  <p>In Master Ghost Valley&#8217;s original
    manuscript the verses are four lines of rhyming Chinese poetry. In our
    translation, we have made each verse into an English poem. Where the meaning is
    obvious from the verses, we have translated it as such. However, much of the
    original wording was written in a cryptic manner and in some instances we have
    maintained the cryptic nature in the translation in order to allow room for
    imagination and discussion.</p>
  <p><strong>Style</strong></p>
  <p>This section adds something extra to finish
    off the reading. We have captured the many cryptic nuances in our translation,
    which might mean that you may need to ponder on some of the possible meanings.<strong></strong></p>
  <p>To illustrate how to interpret the
    readings, we have a used the celebrity example of Elvis Presley. We did some
    basic research on Elvis&#8217;s life on the internet. There is a lot of information
    about Elvis on-line and you may find there are more interpretations of the
    reading for Numeral 3 as applied to Elvis that we have not discovered. </p>
  <p>It would also be helpful for you to read
    the Notes on Symbolism and Historical References in order to help you interpret
    the life readings.</p>

  <p>From the Four Pillars
    Calculator we obtain Numeral 3 for Elvis. Let&#8217;s go through the reading for
    Numeral 3 and see how that relates to Elvis&#8217;s life.</p>
  <p><strong>Stars</strong></p>
  <p>Elvis&#8217;s hour pillar was Bing Yin, which
    means he was born under the Heavenly Obstacle Star. The metaphor for this star is &#8216;Bee flying
    into blossoming bushes&#8217; and the explanation is &#8216;You are very sharp and smart,
    but be careful not to go down the wrong track&#8217;.</p>
  <p>It would be apt to describe Elvis as sharp
    and smart and we could say that in his later days his dependence on
    prescription medications was going down the wrong track.</p>
  <p><strong>Destiny</strong></p>
  <p><em>In technical matters you are a star. Cultural or academic success can be achieved.
    When you want to be alone, you cannot. When you want to socialize and be with
    people you cannot. In difficult times what appears to be a disaster is not a
    disaster. In times of achievement, good fortune is not really good fortune. A
    noble and respectable person you are the target of jealousy by lesser mortals.
    Setting a good example you make a good role model. When you are relaxed you can
    still find things to make you feel uncomfortable. When you are happy you can
    still find reasons to be sad. You have
    siblings and friends, yet it is as if they are not there. Relatives are not
    close to you. Everything is accomplished by yourself, on your own, that is how
    it is in your life. </em></p>
  <p>Elvis was definitely a star and has made a
    huge influence on popular culture. As a
    famous musician, it would have probably been difficult for Elvis to always be
    alone or be with others as and when he chose. Apparently, Elvis did not like
    several of the songs that made him famous, so perhaps in his mind, he did not
    view all his hits as his good fortune. Throughout his life Elvis made many charitable
    donations. In 1970, he was named as one of the Ten
    Outstanding Young Men of the Nation, so we can definitely
    say he set a good example and made a good role model. Elvis
    had a twin brother who was stillborn at birth, so in effect, Elvis was an only
    child. Since Elvis is one of the best-selling solo musical artists, it is fair
    to say that he made his accomplishments on his own.</p>
  <p><strong>Luck
    Verses</strong></p>
  <p><em>Foundation:<br />
  </em><em>From the terrace
    you watch the bright moon.<br />
  </em><em>On the high
    mountain alone you climb.<br />
  </em><em>Unfulfilled dreams
    are dropped along the way.<br />
  </em><em>You seek peace in
    the battlefield of your mind.</em></p>
  <p>To watch the bright
    moon means to succeed. Elvis had great achievement and won many awards
    including three Grammy awards and the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award. As his
    success came from being a solo musical artist, we can say that he climbed the high
    mountain alone. Elvis starred in
    numerous movies, but he wanted to be a serious actor, and this was his
    unfulfilled dream. 1n 1964, Larry Geller became Elvis&#8217;s hairdresser. It is
    reported that Elvis poured his heart out to Larry and started spiritual studies
    with him, to seek peace in the battlefield of his mind.</p>
  <p><em>Life Path:<br />
  </em><em>Looking back you see the whole
    country,<br />
  </em><em>Thousands of miles
    away from home.<br />
  </em><em>In old age you
    reflect on shame and glory,<br />
  </em><em>Let it be, do not lament on your life story.</em></p>
  <p>Elvis toured USA
    extensively and was often thousands of miles away from his home, Graceland in
    Memphis, Tennessee. There was much glory in his hugely successful career, yet he
    suffered problems with his health and battled with his weight in his later
    years.</p>
  <p><em>Marriage:<br />
  </em><em>Will a wedding banquet full of luxury,<br />
  </em><em>Lead to
    satisfaction or misery?<br />
  </em><em>Happy or sad, it is hard to foresee.<br />
  </em><em>To harvest fruit, re-plant the apricot tree.</em></p>
  <p>Elvis and Priscilla
    married on 1<sup>st</sup> May 1967 at the Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas. The
    couple divorced on 9<sup>th</sup> October 1973. The Aladdin Hotel in Las Vegas
    was a luxurious venue and there were happy times for the couple before
    divorcing.</p>
  <p><em>Children:<br />
  </em><em>Beautiful flowers adorn the back
    garden, yet no fruit,<br />
  </em><em>The lovely greenery blossoming and blooming.<br />
  </em><em>Chances are Goat and Tiger years bring offspring.<br />
  </em><em>Handsome fruit on the mulberry tree reflects
    the glory of sunset.</em></p>
  <p>Elvis and Priscilla had
    one child together, Lisa Marie, who was born on 1 February 1968. According to
    the Chinese solar calendar, Lisa Marie was born in the year of the Goat. The poem about children is uncannily accurate
    for Elvis.</p>
  <p><em>Harvest:<br />
  </em><em>In Dragon year opportunities come with
    dragon on water.<br />
  </em><em>Retirement happens in Tiger year, even without
    plans.<br />
  </em><em>With cool breeze and bright moon for quiet
    times,<br />
  </em><em>With pets and plants you enjoy the rural life.</em></p>
  <p>1952, 1964 and 1976
    were dragon years. In researching
    Elvis&#8217;s biography, nothing significant was found for 1952 when Elvis was 17
    years old. In 1964, Elvis started his spiritual studies after meeting Larry
    Geller on 30<sup>th</sup> April. In 1976, Elvis was touring in concert for most
    of the year. Further research into Elvis&#8217;s life might reveal if there is any
    significance to &#8216;dragon on water&#8217;. Elvis
    did not retire as such. However, it is interesting to note that after doing
    some charity concerts in 1961, he did not give a public performance for seven
    years. In 1962, a Tiger year, he took a retirement from performing live in
    public without planning it.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Style: A Horse Going through
    Mountain and River<br />
  </em></strong><em>High winds blow over a thousand miles.<br />
  </em><em>Causing ripples of stormy waters.<br />
  </em><em>With great ambition for many great things,<br />
  </em><em>You are like a goose soaring on powerful wings.<br />
  </em><em>Just as a pine tree stands firmly upright in
    the snow,<br />
  </em><em>When you seek wealth both success and failure
    you will know.<br />
  </em><em>Planting beautiful flowers in spring,<br />
  </em><em>Soon you will enjoy being melancholy.<br />
  </em><em>If you want to know what future success you
    will get,<br />
  </em><em>Imagine you are in fairyland picking a peach at
    sunset.</em></p>
  <p>Was Elvis&#8217;s life like a horse going through
    mountain and river? He certainly, toured
    the USA a lot and travelled many thousands of miles. It is said that his life on the road
    contributed to the breakdown of his marriage to Priscilla. This could be the
    interpretation of the ripples of stormy waters.
    Like a soaring goose, Elvis certainly reached great heights in his
    career and set records for audiences and record sales. Although Elvis&#8217;s movies were hugely
    successful at the box office, they were not well received by film critics &#8211;
    both success and failure you will know. Elvis enjoyed success in his youth,
    with number one hits by the time he was twenty-one. Spring is the time of youth and planting
    beautiful flowers indicates success. Despite all his accomplishments, Elvis was
    not always happy, so he would have felt melancholy at times. To be in fairyland picking a peach means great
    success.</p>
