<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is risky, but not exactly risky.
What appears to be beautiful is not exactly beautiful. In the beginning you
will be humiliated, but in the end you will be glorified. To begin with you
will need to overcome many obstructions and you will get through them all. &nbsp;Move from your hometown and leave your family
behind.&nbsp; Your approach to doing things
lacks good planning, like picking fruit and flowers randomly as you come across
them. You grow up as if fording a torrential stream.&nbsp; You experience the bitterness of frost, with
an unstable existence that is full of sudden rain and strong gusts of wind.&nbsp; What appears to be proper becomes
inappropriate, and may be considered evil. Peaceful situations become
bothersome.&nbsp; Even when you are quiet,
your heart and mind are not at rest.&nbsp; When
your mind is at rest, your feet are busy moving.&nbsp; The Post Horse star and Heavenly Void star shining
together means that life should be leisurely but turns out to be hectic.</p>

The willow bursts into blossom on the coast in the east.<br />
Under night moon, with a clear mind, you watch
waves at sea.<br />
It seems that destiny is having a laugh,

There is always wind and frost when you
ought to be lucky.<br />
Wait till willow is bare, after all the

<p>Life Path:<br />
On the mountain with deep streams flowing,<br />
The beautiful melodies you are playing,<br />
Sound like the dragon&#8217;s splendid singing.<br />
When called you shoot an arrow on horseback.<br />
A virtuous person many find arousing,<br />
Your triumphs have people applauding.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Like peach and willow blossoms scattered when windy,<br />
Romantic relationships are blown apart.<br />
Watch others happy with their sweetheart.<br />
Wait for dark clouds to disperse and wind
to cease,<br />
Then once again, the bright sun you will
see,<br />
Fragrant orchid is in front of window,
finally.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Living remotely with an orchid for

A hut in
the wilderness with a bamboo fence,<br />
The
refreshing wind you can sense.<br />
Fortunately,
blossom is out on one plum tree.<br />
In the west

Means
you will have successful sons.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
When going to the mountains, take care, the tiger can be scary.<br />
Go bravely to make ancestors proud of the

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    First impressions of your life may not reveal the whole story. You will overcome many difficulties at the beginning of your life to enjoy happiness later on.

<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The willow bursts into blossom on the coast in the east. Under night moon, with a clear mind, you watch waves at sea,” means that even though there are good opportunities (“blossoming willow”) you cannot take hold of them because you are on the other side of the sea. You face difficulties (“wind and frost”) when you think you should be lucky. “Wait till the willow is bare, after all the leaves are gone, it will be re-born” means that good fortune will come to you eventually.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “On the mountain with deep streams flowing, the beautiful melodies you are playing, sound like the dragon’s splendid singing” suggests that you have musical talent, or any sort of artistic talent. “When called you shoot an arrow on horseback,” means that you are also someone who can fight for a cause when called to action. Many people find you inspiring.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    There is no need to feel discouraged if your relationships break up when others are happily married. “Wait for dark clouds to disperse and wind to cease, then once again, the bright sun you will see, fragrant orchid is in front of window, finally,” means a wonderful love will be there for you eventually.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Living remotely with an orchid for company. A hut in the wilderness with a bamboo fence,” suggests that you feel the chances for having children are remote. “The refreshing wind you can sense. Fortunately, blossom is out on one plum tree,” implies that before you know it, babies are coming along. You will have successful sons (“In the west garden many peaches and plums”). For followers, good followers will come eventually.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “When going to the mountains, take care, the tiger can be scary” means you have lots of courage when it comes to facing challenges. You can be successful and gain a good reputation (“Make ancestors proud of the family name you carry”). In the end, you can enjoy life (“Under the bright moon by the five lakes you can laugh with pride, for your soul will be blessed by all the stars in the sky”).

The nightingale is singing on the willow tree. In the garden the peach and apricot are blossoming,” suggests that you come from a good family background, yet you leave it behind you. You head into the future on your own (“You row away in a sampan looking for a brighter future).
