<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This life is risky, but not exactly risky.
What appears to be beautiful is not exactly beautiful. In the beginning you
will be humiliated, but in the end you will be glorified. To begin with you
will need to overcome many obstructions and you will get through them all. &nbsp;Move from your hometown and leave your family
behind.&nbsp; Your approach to doing things
lacks good planning, like picking fruit and flowers randomly as you come across
them. You grow up as if fording a torrential stream.&nbsp; You experience the bitterness of frost, with
an unstable existence that is full of sudden rain and strong gusts of wind.&nbsp; What appears to be proper becomes
inappropriate, and may be considered evil. Peaceful situations become
bothersome.&nbsp; Even when you are quiet,
your heart and mind are not at rest.&nbsp; When
your mind is at rest, your feet are busy moving.&nbsp; The Post Horse star and Heavenly Void star shining
together means that life should be leisurely but turns out to be hectic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses<br />
</strong>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
The willow bursts into blossom on the coast in the east.<br />
Under night moon, with a clear mind, you watch
waves at sea.<br />
It seems that destiny is having a laugh,
unfortunately,<br />
There is always wind and frost when you
ought to be lucky.<br />
Wait till willow is bare, after all the
leaves are gone, it will be re-born.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
On the mountain with deep streams flowing,<br />
The beautiful melodies you are playing,<br />
Sound like the dragon&#8217;s splendid singing.<br />
When called you shoot an arrow on horseback.<br />
A virtuous person many find arousing,<br />
Your triumphs have people applauding.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Like peach and willow blossoms scattered when windy,<br />
Romantic relationships are blown apart.<br />
Watch others happy with their sweetheart.<br />
Wait for dark clouds to disperse and wind
to cease,<br />
Then once again, the bright sun you will
see,<br />
Fragrant orchid is in front of window,
finally.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Living remotely with an orchid for
company.<br />
A hut in
the wilderness with a bamboo fence,<br />
The
refreshing wind you can sense.<br />
Fortunately,
blossom is out on one plum tree.<br />
In the west
garden many peaches and plums,<br />
Means
you will have successful sons.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
When going to the mountains, take care, the tiger can be scary.<br />
Go bravely to make ancestors proud of the
family name you carry.<br />
Under the bright moon by the five lakes you
can laugh with pride,<br />
For your soul will be blessed by all the
stars in the sky.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Withered Branch Germinates in Spring<br />
</strong>During
spring all the plants have new branches.<br />
What
appears to be rotten wood also germinates.<br />
The
dignified tiger is roaring in front of the rocks.<br />
Riding
the horse on the path to prosperity is very appropriate.<br />
Bulrushes
burst in autumn, as overhead the wild geese fly south.<br />
The nightingale
is singing on the willow tree.<br />
In the
garden the peach and apricot are blossoming.<br />
Such a
charming family background, yet you leave it all behind.<br />
You row
away in a sampan looking for a brighter future. &nbsp;</p>
