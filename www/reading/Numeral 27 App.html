<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is unpredictable. Sometimes you are
angry, sometimes you are happy. People cannot expect you to be even-tempered. When
it comes to doing what is supposed to be an easy task, you manage to make a
mess of it. When the fruit is already there, instead of just picking it, you
still work hard for it. If there are no worries at present you don&#8217;t feel
comfortable.&nbsp; Despite a good foundation,
you encounter a lot of trials and tribulations.&nbsp;
Somehow you invite people to attack you. Your spouse is vulnerable, and
you will lose your companion more than once. A younger son will have
achievement. Whatever plans you have are well made, but you need to do it all by
yourself. In the beginning there is always difficulty, in the end it becomes
easy.&nbsp; Just as well that you don&#8217;t mind
being busy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Developments and progress come late.<br />
Whatever you inherit you have to
relinquish.<br />
Many a
time you are cut off from your base.<br />
In a strange land you will encounter the
snake,<br />
An unusual opportunity, an empire to
establish.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
A childhood spent in poverty,<br />
Rat and
Dragon years bring victory.<br />
Lending
you a hand are some powerful people,<br />
Starting
own business, make your house beautiful.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
From the green swamp emerge two lotus
flowers,<br />
No need to decide in romantic matters.<br />
Both companions are most helpful,<br />
So enjoy a life quite beautiful.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
When it comes to daughters, three
become two.<br />
Wait for
winter winds for a son, who<br />
Will
bring much glory to the family.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In years of Dragon and Dog things turn
out badly,<br />
With Gui
and Ding not much harmony.<br />
Danger
after danger come menacingly,<br />
Even if
no lawsuits, still loss of money.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
The Lone Wild Goose Flying in the Sky<br />
</strong>It is
not easy to make any progress.<br />
You work
hard in your early days.<br />
Be
careful of your business going sour.<br />
When the wild goose flies over autumn water,
the journey is not smooth. When it flies, it lands and stops a while then flies
off again. <br />
When you launch a business, you stop and start many times.&nbsp;<br />
In spring, there are flowers in the forest
and spotted red petals on the ground.&nbsp;<br />
You can establish your career only when
someone appreciates your ability.&nbsp;<br />
You will have to run a mile further until you
reach the big mountain covered by white cloud.<br />
Eventually, there is success waiting for
you.&nbsp;<br />
Even when you have no tasks at hand you are
still busy in your mind, for you still have to think about what to do next.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Your life is changeable and busy. You face difficulties in the beginning, yet it works out well in the end.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Many a time you are cut off from your base” suggests that you travel far from home. You will encounter an unusual opportunity (“the snake”) and build a business (“an empire to establish”) as result.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    Rat and Dragon years can prove to be successful times. With the support of mentors you can start a profitable business.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can have more than one satisfying romantic relationship.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can have two or three daughters and later on, a son who will have a good achievement. For followers, you can have many followers and those who join you later will turn out to be the most successful.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Dragon years and Dog years can turn out to be unfortunate. Gui years are years ending with the digit 3, e.g. 1993, 2003, 2013, 2023 and Ding years are years ending with digit 7, e.g. 1997, 2007, 2017, 2027. You need to be careful during Gui years and Ding years.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You work hard in the beginning to launch your business, and you need to manage it carefully. You will eventually be successful.
