<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This life is like excavating the mountain
to build a road. It is like digging a well to draw the spring water. You try
your best and make a good effort. You know what you need to do and you can
manage the tasks in hand.&nbsp; What is light
and what is heavy, you already know, and you can distinguish the virtuous and
capable from the foolish. Although you are very clever and possess great
wisdom, your luck is mixed.&nbsp; The centipede
can run fast but it is unlike the dragonfly, it is not as capable as the
dragonfly.&nbsp; Life is like a boat that is
not anchored.&nbsp; Just as the new moon does
not have enough light, setbacks are due to the timing not being right, no need
to blame yourself.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
From the top of the high pavilion you look
afar to see the nine skies.<br />
Winds
blow over the great river making lots of angry waves.<br />
Over
thousands of miles, the mythical big bird Peng flies.<br />
In the
dragon and phoenix mansion, you are the hero who dines.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Many ups and downs, times of glory and
times of shame.<br />
Set
sights to be the prime minister, such high ambitions,<br />
With
ability to pass exams, gain qualifications.<br />
Also,
can overcome own limitations.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Pair of mandarin ducks playing in the
pond,<br />
When you
are in love, be wary of the storm.<br />
Clouds
blown away by wind reveal the bright moon.<br />
Lift the
bamboo screen, to see pomegranate,<br />
Blossoming
beautifully, before your eyes.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Two fruits on the branch, only one
ripens.<br />
Good
luck for your children, from your acts of charity.<br />
One of
your sons will gain a high position.<br />
A
successful son brings the family much glory.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Ox and Horse years, everything is
so near, yet so far.<br />
The
destination is so far away, from wherever you are.<br />
Monkey
and crane dancing together, having fun,<br />
Whilst you
play the flute, the music floats to heaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Begonia Outside the Fence<br />
</strong>High on top of the pavilion look at the
high clouds.<br />
Winds are blowing over the water to make
waves.<br />
If you ask about the fame and fortune you
are seeking, there is a lot of gossip and a lot of controversy in your life.<br />
The night rain hits the flowers and the
petals will be blown away.<br />
The wild goose flies into the bitter cold
wind.<br />
After the darkest day of the winter solstice,
what is unsteady becomes stable.<br />
You do things casually and it soon becomes
natural.<br />
Your character is straightforward and you
can face up to heaven.<br />
Wild goose leaves birthplace and flies
away.<br />
When the string breaks on the lute, you can
replace it with another.<br />
Dealings with relatives are not that warm,
yet you get on well with friends.<br />
Fame and fortune will come again and again.</p>
