<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>You are born under a judicial star that has
power. It is a disciplinarian star which can make you stern. If you have this destiny,
you can start an enterprise or inherit a business from your ancestors. Your
character is such that you can be stern and you can be flexible. Misfortune and
fortune arrive at your door at the same time. You have high ambitions that are
firm.&nbsp; Your nature is kind-hearted but
your words can hurt. When you are laughing, it can turn into frowning. Whatever
is sufficient becomes insufficient. All because you do not bow to authority,
therefore, many a time you have to straighten out things. If you are patient
and know your destiny then you will have enough all the time.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
It is cloudy and dark, but no rain
falls.<br />
Thunder
and lightning become very powerful.<br />
At the
entrance of the mountain, someone gives you an arrow&nbsp;<br />
Which
helps you with accomplishments most of all.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
When you look back, you already knew what
was the plan.<br />
In Ox
and Goat year, you can expect things to happen.<br />
When the
moon comes out of eastern mountain,<br />
And the
red sun sets, then someone will give you a hand,<br />
To
succeed, in reaching paradise pond, in fairyland.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Mandarin ducks are flying into the
lake.<br />
At
midnight the moon becomes bright,<br />
Someone introduces
you to your soul-mate,<br />
It is
pre-destined how the marriage works out.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Fruit ripens on the tree,<br />
It falls
and is washed away.<br />
Due to
your charitable deeds,<br />
You&#8217;ll
get a good son, eventually.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Throughout the year you work hard,
work late.<br />
Yet, at
full moon, no funds for wine to celebrate.<br />
There is
no easy way to succeed,<br />
Because
many a missed opportunity.<br />
Left
behind, you listen to crows at midnight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Wild Goose Flies over the Sand Dunes<br />
</strong>Dark clouds, but no rain, and the thunder
is empty.<br />
Good days come like a flash of lightning.<br />
Wild goose flies over the wide river,
leaving its hometown.<br />
You can only see the pine tree standing
upright in winter.<br />
You have to leave home and leave your
family to make a living.<br />
A lot of flowers, but only one fruit.<br />
During Dragon year you will ride a horse to
heaven.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can come across as strict or demanding, even though your nature is much softer. If you have a more compromising approach, you can make life easier for yourself.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “It is cloudy and dark, but no rain falls”, means the calm before the storm, the quiet time before activities or difficulties begin. There is a lot happening when “Thunder and lightning become very powerful”. “At the entrance of the mountain, someone gives you an arrow”, means someone will give you something useful when you are facing a challenge.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “When the moon comes out of eastern mountain, and the red sun sets, then someone will give you a hand” suggests that you can get the help just when you need it the most. Because you get support you will eventually succeed (“reach paradise pond, in fairyland). 
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “At midnight the moon becomes bright” suggests that the timing for someone to introduce you to your soul mate is not too early or too late.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Fruit ripens on the tree, It falls and is washed away,” suggests that you need to wait patiently for children (fruit) to arrive. For followers, you will eventually have good followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    In ancient China, people used to drink wine outdoors under the light of the full moon, as a monthly celebration. “At full moon, no funds for wine to celebrate” means you do not have a lot of spare cash. To succeed, you need to be aware of opportunities and to grab them with both hands. 
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Dark clouds, but no rain and the thunder is empty”, suggests that there is nothing much happening then all of a sudden you have good luck, “Good days come like a flash of lightning”.  “A lot of flowers, but only one fruit”, suggests that you have more daughters (flowers) than sons (fruits), or more female followers than male followers. “During Dragon year you will ride a horse to heaven” means you can climb the ladder of success during a Dragon year.
