<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This person likes to offer opinions on everything.
Being articulate, you can make use of your good speaking skills.&nbsp; You travel a lot, moving about from north to
south, then south to north throughout your life. When you are in a hurry you can
invite gossip. Love can turn into hate in your life. Brothers and sisters have
different ideas to you. Friends cannot be too close to you. When you try to
cover up your true feelings, you expose the reality. Do not pretend to be
friendly with people who will not be your friends. There are days when your
luck has yet to come. When the green dragon goes into the sea, then your name
will be spread far and wide like thunder over the plain. This is when good luck
comes to you.</p>

Classy
mansion with famous garden, full of the air of spring.<br />
Outside
the door peach and plum laughing in spring wind,<br />

From a double career you get double glory.<br />
Moving to a new home, there&#8217;s a boat to
carry.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
In middle of green waves, mandarin ducks playing,<br />
Not noticing other
water fowls, not socializing.<br />
Setting sun is
coming near in the evening.<br />
Fly up to bare
birch tree, a swallow gracefully dancing.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Three branches, three flowers, in the clouds, blossoming.<br />
At night wind and
rain are coming.<br />
During prime years,
grandchildren arriving.<br />
Good wind brings
you many glad tidings.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Ding and Ren years do not travel by boat.<br />
Water Rooster year, something to worry
about.<br />
For sixteen years, many minor hassles.<br />
Under the stars at night go fishing.</p>

</strong>You are a high ranking officer who can
visit the emperor&#8217;s palace.<br />
Originally, you came from a poor family.<br />
You are impatient and walk fast, so you get
tired and complain about the distance.<br />
When you have luck, you will meet with
happy events.<br />
Whoever you said goodbye to when you left
home, were not your friends.<br />
When you meet again, they become good
friends.<br />
What exactly is your career? You do not
need to bother to ask.<br />
Willow in spring decorates your exterior
walls means whatever you do you will succeed.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “When the green dragon goes into the sea, then your name will be spread like thunder over the plain,” has the connotation that you will become renowned, when the time is right.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Classy mansion with famous garden, full of the air in spring” suggests that you have the good luck to live in a fabulous residence. “Outside the door peach and plum laughing in spring wind” means that you are in demand as a mentor with many who wish to study with you. In China there was the system of imperial exams, which was used for selecting government officials. Those who got the highest marks would get to meet the emperor.  “Passed exams went and saw the emperor,” implies that you gained top qualifications, which led to a good start in your career.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Moving to a new home, there’s a boat to carry,” suggests that you move with a lot of possessions. In ancient China this would happen if you were an official in the empire being sent to do a job in another location and the government funded your move. “From a double career, you get double glory,” implies that you succeed in different roles. In a modern context this could be the description of a life of an expatriate who changes roles.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    A close and happy relationship is predicted. As a couple, you enjoy each other’s company (“Not noticing other waterfowls and not socializing,”). Romance and domestic bliss continues in your late years (“swallow gracefully dancing”).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Children and grandchildren are predicted. Your descendants bring you much happiness (“Good wind brings you many glad tidings”). For followers, you can expect many loyal ones.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Under the stars at night go fishing,” suggests that you take it easy (“go fishing”) late in life (“at night”).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “You are a high ranking officer who can visit the emperor’s palace,” means you are someone who can rise through the ranks and get close to the source of power. This suggests that you might be at a senior level in a company, close to the CEO, or you might have a senior role in the government or a large organisation.
