<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is like gold and jade, it is
ruled by a brilliant star.&nbsp; This is a
kind star that brings gourmet food and beautiful clothing.&nbsp; You can shoulder responsibility and have the
ability to manage.&nbsp; You pretend to be
cautious and applaud loudly. When you offer incense to Buddha, you are a bit
lazy about talking to Buddha, suggesting a lack of sincerity in worship. You
want to help people and don&#8217;t want to hurt others.&nbsp; Getting seriously rich and building an empire
is what motivates you.&nbsp; There is always a
road paved for you to escape from misfortune, yet when you think all will
happen easily, there are barriers.&nbsp;
Whatever you gain, you have to work hard for it. Superiors love you, yet
you lack a good rapport with subordinates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
It is not difficult for you to get to
see the emperor.<br />
When you
come, two mountain ranges obstruct the way.<br />
Who
knows why? Yet picture looks good and you can make it easily.<br />
About
own matters you&#8217;re leisurely, other people&#8217;s problems keep you busy.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
When your hair&#8217;s grey your wealth will
be plenty.<br />
Achievement
will also come belatedly.<br />
You
acquire fields, orchards, lots of property.<br />
Looking
back, a life lived beautifully.&nbsp;<br />
Walked
ten thousand miles, worked diligently.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Mandarin ducks snooze cozily together,<br />
Amongst
blossoms, it&#8217;s a beautiful picture.<br />
At night time lots of other birds gather
around.<br />
Yet you are still afraid of the rain and
wind.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
At night time the fruits ripen,<br />
Late in
life you&#8217;ll have a son.<br />
East
winds brings you many students,<br />
Indicative
of your power and influence.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
When you are old, in Ox and Horse
years, take care.<br />
Maple
trees by the riverside.<br />
Life is
like a dream, you should be aware.<br />
Setting moon hides behind a tree.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Meeting Someone at the Golden Gate<br />
</strong>Single-minded about conquering the two
mountains, yet you don&#8217;t have the time, you are too busy.<br />
There is a boat waiting for you by the
riverside.<br />
Money is hiding, like the moon hides behind
the clouds, wait for wealth.<br />
Work very hard but everything turns into a
dream.<br />
It is not too difficult to meet with
someone on the way.<br />
When the time is right and the yang qi
begins to turn, then you will be summoned to the golden gate to meet the
emperor.<br />
You are flexible and well-planned.<br />
When you are young there are a lot of
advancement and retreats, a lot of ups and downs.<br />
When your hair is grey, you will have the
time of your life. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    In this life you can enjoy luxury. Even though you might not be devout when it comes to religion (“When you offer incense to Buddha, you are a bit lazy about talking to Buddha”), you are kind towards others.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “It’s not difficult for you to get to see the emperor” means you can easily get close to powerful people. “Two mountain ranges obstruct the way” means you encounter obstacles on your way to the top.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    Because of your hard work you can enjoy your success in your later years.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Mandarin ducks snooze cozily together” implies a happy couple. “At night time lots of other birds gather round” suggests you can enjoy the company of friends. “Afraid of the rain and wind” means you have minor worries on your mind.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “At night time the fruits ripen” suggests children will come late in life (night time means late). The east wind is fortunate. You will be influential and have a lot of students or followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    The maple tree is symbolic of good fortune. You can enjoy your later years, yet you need to be careful in Ox and Horse years.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can be single-minded about taking on challenges (“conquering the two mountains”). Opportunities are available to you, like “a boat waiting for you by the riverside”. When you are “summoned to the golden gate to meet the emperor”, you meet an influential person who can promote you and give you more power. By taking some action at the right time, you set the wheels in motion (“yang qi begins to turn”) for meeting the important mentor.
