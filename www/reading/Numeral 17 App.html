<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This life is like gold and jade, it is
ruled by a brilliant star.&nbsp; This is a
kind star that brings gourmet food and beautiful clothing.&nbsp; You can shoulder responsibility and have the
ability to manage.&nbsp; You pretend to be
cautious and applaud loudly. When you offer incense to Buddha, you are a bit
lazy about talking to Buddha, suggesting a lack of sincerity in worship. You
want to help people and don&#8217;t want to hurt others.&nbsp; Getting seriously rich and building an empire
is what motivates you.&nbsp; There is always a
road paved for you to escape from misfortune, yet when you think all will
happen easily, there are barriers.&nbsp;
Whatever you gain, you have to work hard for it. Superiors love you, yet
you lack a good rapport with subordinates.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
It is not difficult for you to get to
see the emperor.<br />
When you
come, two mountain ranges obstruct the way.<br />
Who
knows why? Yet picture looks good and you can make it easily.<br />
About
own matters you&#8217;re leisurely, other people&#8217;s problems keep you busy.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
When your hair&#8217;s grey your wealth will
be plenty.<br />
Achievement
will also come belatedly.<br />
You
acquire fields, orchards, lots of property.<br />
Looking
back, a life lived beautifully.&nbsp;<br />
Walked
ten thousand miles, worked diligently.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Mandarin ducks snooze cozily together,<br />
Amongst
blossoms, it&#8217;s a beautiful picture.<br />
At night time lots of other birds gather
around.<br />
Yet you are still afraid of the rain and
wind.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
At night time the fruits ripen,<br />
Late in
life you&#8217;ll have a son.<br />
East
winds brings you many students,<br />
Indicative
of your power and influence.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
When you are old, in Ox and Horse
years, take care.<br />
Maple
trees by the riverside.<br />
Life is
like a dream, you should be aware.<br />
Setting moon hides behind a tree.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Meeting Someone at the Golden Gate<br />
</strong>Single-minded about conquering the two
mountains, yet you don&#8217;t have the time, you are too busy.<br />
There is a boat waiting for you by the
riverside.<br />
Money is hiding, like the moon hides behind
the clouds, wait for wealth.<br />
Work very hard but everything turns into a
dream.<br />
It is not too difficult to meet with
someone on the way.<br />
When the time is right and the yang qi
begins to turn, then you will be summoned to the golden gate to meet the
emperor.<br />
You are flexible and well-planned.<br />
When you are young there are a lot of
advancement and retreats, a lot of ups and downs.<br />
When your hair is grey, you will have the
time of your life. &nbsp;</p>
