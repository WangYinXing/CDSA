<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This life is like bare branches meeting
spring and it is like withered buds meeting the rain. After all the dangers,
difficulties and barriers you will meet something to arouse your spirits.
Before you turn forty you have worked very hard. Then you will be able to enjoy
fortune. If not for the cold ice in the bottom of the water the plum tree
cannot be blossoming in the garden.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
When the lifeboat is sailing on high
waves, there&#8217;s no need for a paddle.<br />
Throughout
life success and failure are just like the waves, why struggle?<br />
Bring
your musical instrument to the tent of the commander.<br />
And with
your ability, follow the hero to become wealthy.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
In middle age, good tidings to bring you to glorious lands, oh!<br />
Old plum tree blossoms after going through
frost and snow.<br />
There&#8217;s hope by the waterside where green grass
grows.<br />
Bring your musical instrument to the
wealthy and powerful.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
In early days mandarin ducks get together.<br />
In spring wind, they play in clear water.<br />
Recollecting these days, it is like a dream,
an ideal picture.<br />
In later days, on another branch, another
beautiful flower.</p>
<p>Children: <br />
Three flowers blossom leaving two fruits
hanging.<br />
In late years there&#8217;s more, there&#8217;s another
one coming.<br />
All of them know how to bring glory to the family.<br />
Be grateful and offer incense to heaven
thankfully.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Remember all the gossip you had to handle.<br />
Now you are lucky there&#8217;s no more scandal.<br />
When you can wear gold belt with clothes
beautiful,<br />
It&#8217;s time to go fishing, retire after being
successful.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Tiger Crouching in the Plum Forest<br />
</strong>In the evening tides row a sampan alone.<br />
Failures and success throughout your life
are like waves.<br />
Sail your boat towards the north-west
(power) when the wind is with you.<br />
If you turn towards south-east (wealth),
the waves will be high again.<br />
Wild geese are flying over the water.&nbsp;<br />
Danger of mandarin ducks getting lost under
the bridge.<br />
Who knows when the tiger is roaring in the
forest?<br />
Then you know how bold and daring the hero
is.<br />
When you encounter danger then you will
show bravery.</p>
