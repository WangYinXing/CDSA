<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>In this life there is often a lot on your
mind, not everything will be successful. Therefore, you need to accept that
some things will work out a lot better than others. &nbsp;Relatives cannot be relied upon, and siblings
lack fondness towards you. The early roots and foundation are limited. Laziness
prevents early academic success. When the Heavenly Gloomy star and the Heavenly
Dim star come, there is hidden illness that cannot be revealed. You can shine
as a pioneer, moving back and forth, in order to get rid of the old system and to
bring in a revolutionary new order. Do not expect much help from friends and be
prepared for relatives to bring you worries. This is all because of the difficulties
brought by frosty winds early in your life. Trust that there is someone who can
decide everything in your life.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Fire logs on your shoulder, on a risky path into deep forest,<br />
You see gold when you&#8217;re halfway there.<br />
It doesn&#8217;t run smooth when you try your
hardest.<br />
To pursue the deer, go easy, they&#8217;re just
there.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Not been loving throughout life is a cause for regret.<br />
A dead tree to glorify in spring, how can
you expect?<br />
Always found on autumn river, are those who
understand.<br />
See the important waterway in year of Dog
or of Dragon.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
The mirror in your hand is obviously
broken.<br />
Although
it can be repaired, won&#8217;t happen.<br />
A past
life means marriage is pre-destined.<br />
No need
to be bitter about the outcome.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
In mid-spring one flower is trying to blossom.<br />
Unfortunately, you have to travel by boat
in a choppy sea.<br />
You have been working hard, so heaven
offers sympathy,<br />
And bestows upon you a son, to serve you
when you&#8217;re elderly.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
You cannot go back to the five lakes.<br />
In your
late years, one fruit to serve you nicely.<br />
It is
your fate when year of Dragon or Snake,<br />
Collapse
by the river, end of the story.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Purple Swallow Building a Nest<br />
</strong>High ambition in a character that is very stern.<br />
Whether it is bitter or sweet you still
manage to run the business.<br />
Purple swallow builds a nest elsewhere.<br />
Wild geese cannot stand together.<br />
You tell the truth and invite condemnation.<br />
Your children cannot be of much help.<br />
You are admitted through the golden door,
even though you weren&#8217;t meant to be, because of the carelessness of those in
charge.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “When the Heavenly Gloomy star and Heavenly Dim star come, there is hidden illness that cannot be revealed” implies that you need to take good care of your health and watch out for illnesses which are not easy to spot. “Frosty winds early in your life” suggests challenging times during childhood.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You go on an adventure (“risky path into deep forest”) and encounter an opportunity for gaining wealth (“see gold when you’re halfway there”). There is no need to try too hard when it comes to pursuing your goals (“deer”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    If you do not put much affection into a relationship, you cannot expect to get much support. You encounter understanding people, possibly whilst travelling or near water. You see the way ahead (“important waterway”) in a Dog year or a Dragon year.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    It is not possible to mend a broken relationship (“mirror in your hand is obviously broken”). Karma from a past life affected your marriage in this lifetime.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    You have to work away from home (“travel by boat in a choppy sea”), yet you get to enjoy your son’s company when you are old. For followers, you have loyal followers who will stick with you.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “You cannot go back to the five lakes” means you cannot go back to travelling the country. Be careful in a Dragon year or Snake year.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Purple swallow builds a nest elsewhere. Wild geese cannot stand together” suggests that you spend a lot of time apart from your family. You are admitted into somewhere fabulous, even though you weren’t meant to be entering, because those in charge dropped their guard.
