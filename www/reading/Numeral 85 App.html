<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>You are born with a character that is stiff
and bold. Highly ambitious, whatever you do, you go into a lot of details in
the planning. Whenever you talk you can control the crowds. You stand upright
like the pine tree in the cold. You are beautiful like the lonely moon shining
above. Relatives will distance themselves from you and it is hard to get
together with your brothers and sisters. Whatever comes together has to part.
Whatever is successful carries some failed parts. Noble people will be very
helpful if you respect them. You will not be a stupid flatterer and you do not
like to be flattered. You lament the good days going too fast and the good
things coming too late. Once you have met your bosom friend your career will
climb to the top.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
With some
ups and downs, your luck can flounder.<br />
Many happenings
in life are like going through barriers.<br />
Goat and Dog years bring nice days you can
look back on,<br />
Lovely to ride on the deer and ox between
two mountains.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Hear the thunder, hear the thunder,
rainstorms coming.<br />
Flying dragon and dancing phoenix, fortune they&#8217;re
bringing.<br />
Sitting on the terrace, leisurely sitting.<br />
Kun fish becomes big bird Peng, to jade
hall it&#8217;s flying.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
String broken on musical instrument,
replace with another.<br />
Loss of
the spouse, there&#8217;s tears wetting clothes all over.<br />
Swallow
flying away leaving people feeling saddened.<br />
On high
mountain hear the water with no companion</p>
<p>Children:<br />
After the flowers are gone, there is one fruit.<br />
Fruit that comes
late is most becoming.<br />
Mulberry trees blooming,
grandchildren are coming.<br />
See the cowboy in
the breeze, the flute he&#8217;s playing.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Goat or Dog years prepare for the road to heaven.<br />
Happiness and sadness mingle on reflection.<br />
Look back on events that brought you glory.<br />
Days are numbered, even though spring wind
comes strongly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Jade and Gold Filling the Hall<br />
</strong>Wild goose by the riverside is screaming in
the autumn wind.<br />
One bird comes to occupy the bushes.<br />
Without karma, even when you come close to
each other, you will not meet.<br />
With karma, even if you are a thousand
miles apart, you will meet each other.<br />
Old cinnamon trees after passing three
autumns will still be beautiful.<br />
Thousand year old peach tree will produce
one red fruit.<br />
If the nobleman is riding the precious horse,
the hall filled with jade and gold will be decorated with silk</p>

<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Lovely to ride on the deer and ox between two mountains,” suggests that you have good times since the deer is symbolic of good luck and the ox is reliable.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Flying dragon and dancing phoenix, fortune they’re bringing” means you can expect good luck after facing difficulties (“rainstorms”). “Kun fish becomes big bird peng, to jade hall it’s flying,” implies that you can re-invent yourself and go far to prestigious places. Kun fish is a mythical fish that can transform itself into big bird peng, a large mythical bird with the ability to fly long distances.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    It is predicted that you go through the loss of a relationship (“string broken on musical instrument”), which is sad. However, you can find someone else and settle down again.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    It is predicted that a son who is born when you are older is quite an amazing character. You will be happy (“cowboy in the breeze, the flute he is playing”) because there will be grandchildren. For followers, you can expect to have an outstanding follower who will continue your legacy.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    When you look back on your life there are ups and downs, yet you enjoy good luck (“spring wind comes strongly”) towards the end of your days.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    There is a time when you are on your own (“wild goose by the riverside is screaming in the autumn wind” and “one bird comes to occupy the bushes”), yet you are destined to meet your match. “Old cinnamon trees after passing three autumns will still be beautiful,” suggests that you enjoy good luck over a length of time. You have an outstanding son (“A thousand year old peach tree will produce one red fruit,”). You can encounter a noble person to help you to succeed.
