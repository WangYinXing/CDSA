<p><strong>Destiny<br />
</strong>You are born with a character that is stiff
and bold. Highly ambitious, whatever you do, you go into a lot of details in
the planning. Whenever you talk you can control the crowds. You stand upright
like the pine tree in the cold. You are beautiful like the lonely moon shining
above. Relatives will distance themselves from you and it is hard to get
together with your brothers and sisters. Whatever comes together has to part.
Whatever is successful carries some failed parts. Noble people will be very
helpful if you respect them. You will not be a stupid flatterer and you do not
like to be flattered. You lament the good days going too fast and the good
things coming too late. Once you have met your bosom friend your career will
climb to the top.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
With some
ups and downs, your luck can flounder.<br />
Many happenings
in life are like going through barriers.<br />
Goat and Dog years bring nice days you can
look back on,<br />
Lovely to ride on the deer and ox between
two mountains.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Hear the thunder, hear the thunder,
rainstorms coming.<br />
Flying dragon and dancing phoenix, fortune they&#8217;re
bringing.<br />
Sitting on the terrace, leisurely sitting.<br />
Kun fish becomes big bird Peng, to jade
hall it&#8217;s flying.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
String broken on musical instrument,
replace with another.<br />
Loss of
the spouse, there&#8217;s tears wetting clothes all over.<br />
Swallow
flying away leaving people feeling saddened.<br />
On high
mountain hear the water with no companion</p>
<p>Children:<br />
After the flowers are gone, there is one fruit.<br />
Fruit that comes
late is most becoming.<br />
Mulberry trees blooming,
grandchildren are coming.<br />
See the cowboy in
the breeze, the flute he&#8217;s playing.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Goat or Dog years prepare for the road to heaven.<br />
Happiness and sadness mingle on reflection.<br />
Look back on events that brought you glory.<br />
Days are numbered, even though spring wind
comes strongly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Jade and Gold Filling the Hall<br />
</strong>Wild goose by the riverside is screaming in
the autumn wind.<br />
One bird comes to occupy the bushes.<br />
Without karma, even when you come close to
each other, you will not meet.<br />
With karma, even if you are a thousand
miles apart, you will meet each other.<br />
Old cinnamon trees after passing three
autumns will still be beautiful.<br />
Thousand year old peach tree will produce
one red fruit.<br />
If the nobleman is riding the precious horse,
the hall filled with jade and gold will be decorated with silk</p>
