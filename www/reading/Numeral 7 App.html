<p><strong>Destiny:
</strong></p>
<p>You can be rigid or flexible.&nbsp; When it comes to weighing up the pros and
cons, you do it most carefully. With much hard work in the early years,
prosperity comes late. Problems are solved? Not quite. Have you reached your
destination? Not quite.&nbsp; Many times you
are almost there.&nbsp; Enthusiasm does not
last long enough for you to run the whole course.&nbsp; If some people do not acknowledge you, they
are superficial and have judged you on your appearance. Relationships with your
relatives are not that supportive or caring. It is suitable to have sons later
in life.&nbsp; Decision-making is not
straightforward and you need to overcome blocks before you can decide. There seems
to be a hundred things to think about and to worry about.&nbsp;&nbsp; If you do business on your own, your good
reputation exceeds the financial rewards.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Whether you are female or male,<br />
Romance
will come without fail.<br />
One
hundred years of happiness is your fate,<br />
A good
reputation will come, it could be late.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
During the year of the Dog, you are
like a bird with new wings.<br />
Year of
Rooster and Ox, you will have new weapons, new things.<br />
You can
meet helpful people at the waterside,<br />
This
leads to success, working side by side.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
You could well remain single,<br />
Or if
you marry you become a widow.<br />
You have
fame, so the opposite sex, you can attract.<br />
Yet, relationships don&#8217;t seem to last.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Fruits don&#8217;t like it when it is rainy.<br />
For
little ones to fall ill it is so easy.<br />
Those
born under Ox or Goat, will be lucky,<br />
Because
they will grow up healthy.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Geng and Xin bring worries, these
years seem the darkest.<br />
Thereafter,
in Ren and Gui years reap a good harvest.<br />
The
bright moon sets in autumn.<br />
Enjoy a
quiet life on retirement.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Flower Meeting Late Spring<br />
</strong>After getting married, you will be widowed.<br />
Your character is clever and open.<br />
Wild geese fly in formation.<br />
When you are drunk, you dream of fame and
fortune.<br />
To have daughters is better than having
sons.<br />
Relationships outside marriage, like
butterflies on flowers won&#8217;t last.<br />
If a good friend comes from afar, open a
bottle of wine and have a laugh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Footnote 1<br />
A stream flowing into
one pond, then flowing into another, forms a figure of eight shape. This shape
is referred to as &#8216;calabash water&#8217;, since it is the same shape as the calabash
gourd.&nbsp;</p>
