<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>The fairies are plowing the fields. A beautiful and
well to do woman fetches water from the river.&nbsp;
These images suggest that at your most leisurely, you will create
hardship for yourself. You find it hard to enjoy life.&nbsp; Although you are generous, intelligent and knowledgeable,
you endeavor to establish several businesses without much success. Eventually,
you will be able depend on one or two small businesses to keep you going. It
seems as if you have to take care of a lot of things by yourself because your son
is not helpful. When good fortune arrives you are not really able to take
pleasure from it.&nbsp; You are an unselfish
and honest character, yet when you are kind to others, they will not
reciprocate. </p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Green pine, green willow, green willow,
green pine.<br />
Like a crane that leaves its nest, you soar
up in sky.<br />
Yet you come back to the earth and get
dusty, why?<br />
As no support from pine and willow branches,
upon, which you can rely.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
In Pig year or Dog year you&#8217;re standing
by riverside.<br />
It&#8217;s
time to climb the ladder, to reach the sky.<br />
Gold,
jade and mulberry trees can all be acquired.<br />
A
powerful person gives a helping hand at your side,</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Herons leisurely swimming in the
swamp.<br />
When the
moon is bright, what about a partner?<br />
Meet a match
after travelling to a distant land.<br />
Find
true love and a good companion.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
The flowers are battered by night rain.<br />
In later years you
will have a son,<br />
A letter of good
tidings, he will be sending.<br />
Of his great
achievements, he will be telling.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Dragon and Tiger years you&#8217;ll meet
good friends.<br />
The ship
has sailed far, open sails to sail faster.<br />
If you
sail too fast in the river, the jewels you drop.<br />
Alas,
they cannot be found, splash, plop, plop.</p>

<p><strong>Style:
Bird Standing in Pine Forest<br />
</strong>When the bird is hatched it flies away from
the nest.<br />
Landing on the branch of the green pine
tree where it perches.<br />
After your studies are over, you start
work.<br />
You want to revive family business, but it
is not that easy.<br />
Wild geese find it hard to fly in the clouds.<br />
Mandarin ducks are battered by rain.<br />
It is difficult for your children to be
with you, but you bring it upon yourself.<br />
When you want to launch a project, wait for
right timing.<br />
Wait until the moon shines over terrace.<br />
In the beginning you may fail in a lot of
your undertakings.<br />
Eventually, you will have the trees and
flowers in your garden. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
