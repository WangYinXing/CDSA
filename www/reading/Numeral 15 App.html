<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>The fairies are plowing the fields. A beautiful and
well to do woman fetches water from the river.&nbsp;
These images suggest that at your most leisurely, you will create
hardship for yourself. You find it hard to enjoy life.&nbsp; Although you are generous, intelligent and knowledgeable,
you endeavor to establish several businesses without much success. Eventually,
you will be able depend on one or two small businesses to keep you going. It
seems as if you have to take care of a lot of things by yourself because your son
is not helpful. When good fortune arrives you are not really able to take
pleasure from it.&nbsp; You are an unselfish
and honest character, yet when you are kind to others, they will not
reciprocate. </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Green pine, green willow, green willow,
green pine.<br />
Like a crane that leaves its nest, you soar
up in sky.<br />
Yet you come back to the earth and get
dusty, why?<br />
As no support from pine and willow branches,
upon, which you can rely.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
In Pig year or Dog year you&#8217;re standing
by riverside.<br />
It&#8217;s
time to climb the ladder, to reach the sky.<br />
Gold,
jade and mulberry trees can all be acquired.<br />
A
powerful person gives a helping hand at your side,</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Herons leisurely swimming in the
swamp.<br />
When the
moon is bright, what about a partner?<br />
Meet a match
after travelling to a distant land.<br />
Find
true love and a good companion.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
The flowers are battered by night rain.<br />
In later years you
will have a son,<br />
A letter of good
tidings, he will be sending.<br />
Of his great
achievements, he will be telling.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Dragon and Tiger years you&#8217;ll meet
good friends.<br />
The ship
has sailed far, open sails to sail faster.<br />
If you
sail too fast in the river, the jewels you drop.<br />
Alas,
they cannot be found, splash, plop, plop.</p>
<p><br />

<p><strong>Style:
Bird Standing in Pine Forest<br />
</strong>When the bird is hatched it flies away from
the nest.<br />
Landing on the branch of the green pine
tree where it perches.<br />
After your studies are over, you start
work.<br />
You want to revive family business, but it
is not that easy.<br />
Wild geese find it hard to fly in the clouds.<br />
Mandarin ducks are battered by rain.<br />
It is difficult for your children to be
with you, but you bring it upon yourself.<br />
When you want to launch a project, wait for
right timing.<br />
Wait until the moon shines over terrace.<br />
In the beginning you may fail in a lot of
your undertakings.<br />
Eventually, you will have the trees and
flowers in your garden. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    It seems as if you are your own worst enemy as you make life hard for yourself. It can be your choice to enjoy life.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Like a crane that leaves its nest, you soar up in the sky”, means you have high ambitions and you follow through on your plans. “Yet you come back to the earth and get dusty” means your progress is slowed because you need to attend to the practical details. You end up being responsible for sorting out the practicalities because there is nobody else to help out (“no support from pine and willow branches”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    The time to go for your goals is during a Pig year or a Dog year. To “stand by the riverside” implies that you are ready to cross the river, to take a big step. Or, it can mean that there is a significant event when you are at the riverside. “Gold, jade and mulberry trees” refers to money and property.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Herons leisurely swimming in the swamp” implies you think that you are not in a hurry to settle down. A bright moon is symbolic of good fortune. You should look for a soul mate during fortunate times. When you travel to somewhere far away, you can find the one.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The flowers are battered by night rain,” suggests that you might need to be patient when it comes to having children. It is predicted that a son you have in later years will eventually move away and become successful. For followers, capable followers will come later.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can meet good friends in Dragon years and Tiger years and go far doing business together, “ship has sailed far”. You need to be careful with expanding your business. “If you sail too fast in the river, the jewels you drop”, implies that if you attempt to grow too quickly you can lose your profits (“jewels”).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Wild geese find it hard to fly in the clouds” suggests that you can encounter some challenges in going for your goals. “Mandarin ducks are battered by rain” implies that you face troubles together with your spouse. To have “trees and flowers in your garden” means you will have a blossoming success.
