<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is like an outstanding star
shining brilliantly in the chaotic universe. Yet when watching from the ground
it is like a heavy and muddy star in a comet. &nbsp;There is a beginning but no ending. Forget the
past and lose the future. When it comes to making friends, it is easy for you
to come together and easy for you to part with them.&nbsp; Among relatives, three of them are happy to
be in your company, yet two of them are worried about staying together with
you. It is suitable to be half a monk and half a layman.&nbsp; It is only in this way can you go after fame
and fortune. This suggests you can be a worldly religious person who is able to
apply spiritual values to be successful.&nbsp;
Spouse and children are in danger of being lost. You cannot live on the inherited
business.&nbsp; It is not suitable to live
alone by yourself, it is better for you mix with others and to live under the
same roof with various other people.</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Unseen pearl from the sea, nobody knows its value,<br />
Hide behind the
scene this will be true of you.<br />
Dragon and
phoenix dancing, a dazzling display,<br />
To get a good
name put on a show, this is the way.<br />
Gold has to be refined many times before it
is shiny.<br />
To get close to
the emperor, need to have met noble people already.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Get rid of the old and change for the new, time
to reform.<br />
You should speak up to be different from
the norm.<br />
Somebody who appears to have nothing to do
with you,<br />
Eventually becomes somebody who is close to
you.<br />
In your path to the future are boastful people,<br />
Where you meet them are in places most
vital.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Cast net to catch fish, it meets the tide,
good timing.<br />
Mandarin ducks and water fowls together are
playing.<br />
Moon is bright, stars are shining, where is
the one?<br />
The clever crane is sending you the false
message.<br />
It is not for real, using a feather to form
a bridge.<br />
All tidings are false hopes, once the
chance is missed.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Peach and pear tree, two flowers and one fruit.<br />
Later in life, one fruit, that&#8217;s strangely
crimson.<br />
Mulberry, orchids and cinnamon, so
pleasant,<br />
A charming scene, children have great achievement.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Tiger and Rabbit years on the mountain
climbing, in the rabbit garden running.<br />
Cuckoo tears flowing down, tears are
flowing.<br />
Anytime, have good scene of bright moon and
cool breeze.<br />
Like the crane that flies in blue sky you
can come and go freely.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Jade Branch with Fairy Peach<br />
</strong>A huge, hard rock is hiding jade inside.<br />
Gold is made in the cold sand.<br />
When you are in a strange land you should work
hard.<br />
Do not worry about your country.<br />
When you really want to plant flowers, they
will wither.<br />
When you do not intend to plant willow,
willow tree will give you shelter.<br />
If you want to find real treasure, you need
to look by the water.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “It is suitable to be half a monk and half a layman,” suggests that you can find a balance between spiritual values and materialistic desires. Learn to live in the present and not be concerned about what others might think.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    Dragon and phoenix dancing, a dazzling display,” suggests that you need to be prepared to show your ability, in order to make a name for yourself. “Gold has to be refined many times before it is shiny,” means that you keep developing your skills. “To get close to the emperor, need to have met noble people already,” implies that being well connected is important for getting to know those at the top.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are likely to bring about change. Do not be afraid to speak about your ideas. Who you meet and where you meet them is important to your success.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    There are opportunities for finding a relationship (“Cast your net to catch fish, it meets the tide with good timing”). Be realistic when it comes to choosing a spouse, because you do not want to miss a good chance.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Two daughters and one son are predicted (“two flowers and one fruit”). “One fruit, that’s strangely crimson” could be referring to an outstanding son, who might come along later in life. For followers, you attract capable ones.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Tiger and Rabbit years are likely to bring challenges (“on the mountain climbing, in the rabbit garden running”), and you might have reasons to feel sad (“Cuckoo tears flowing down”). Nevertheless, there are many good times (“bright moon and cooling breeze”) and you enjoy a sense of freedom.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You have hidden talents (“hard rock is hiding jade inside”) and your skills need to be refined (“Gold is made in the cold sand”). There is no need to try too hard (“When you really want to plant flowers, they will wither”), for you will get what you need (“When you do not intend to plant willow, the willow tree will give you shelter”).
