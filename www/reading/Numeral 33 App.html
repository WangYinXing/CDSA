<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is one which is full of good
planning. You have good management skills and organizing ability.&nbsp; Though you are careful in speech, your
character is rigid and impatient.&nbsp;You are very thoughtful with everything.
Many times you encounter bad luck of the Retreating Spirit, but you are not in
real danger, even if the situation is risky.&nbsp;
Two leaves and three flowers then you can get the fruit means you need
to do more work before you see the result. Copper bowl and iron brush means you
must marry a hard-working spouse, someone with good endurance.&nbsp; You will be wronged by ignoble people, and
get yourself into trouble.&nbsp; Do not make
friends with disagreeable people. You cannot take over a family business.&nbsp; It is important to find a golden friend who
can help you turn an ordinary situation into something wondrous.</p>
