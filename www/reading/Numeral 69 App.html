<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This life is like the auspicious dragon&#8217;s
head with the inauspicious snake&#8217;s tail. It is a destiny that offends the
Retreating Spirit. Wealth meets the Exhausting Spirit and you cannot retain
money. Your character is outspoken and frank. When you fail in the beginning, you
will find success in the end. Husband and wife get success early together. Siblings
betray each other.&nbsp; You try hard to
develop business, yet wealth is not retained and there is a lot of wasted
effort. If you want to be successful wait until you reach sixty years of age.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Looks like a fisherman&#8217;s house in
waters misty,<br />
Your
home is in the five lakes and four seas.<br />
Withdraw
fishing rod and net, when wind drops, waves calmer,<br />
Enjoy
life in a picturesque place of white and red flowers.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
In worldly matters, much sincerity, pour in plenty of energy.<br />
After many comings and goings, many times
you get the glory.<br />
Looking back to see beyond clouds, there the
wide skies.<br />
Stop fishing pull out the net and enjoy the
rest of your life.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
When the tree is under attack of gusts and heavy rain,<br />
Pair of mandarin ducks need to decide, fly
or not to fly?<br />
Eventually, mandarin ducks are all over the
pond with plant life.<br />
When bright moon shines over fishing bank,
the dim stars in short supply.</p>
<p>Children: <br />
Flowers blossom on the tree,<br />
In autumn, fruits left, there&#8217;re three.<br />
Outside your door a branch, a phoenix son
when you&#8217;re old,<br />
Who brings glory to your family, praise to
your household.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Who believes there is so much danger in those years?<br />
One unpredictable event brings concerns and
fears.<br />
A lot of regrets on the mountain and with
flowing streams,<br />
The restaurant, where good times were had,
no longer seen.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Rain Battering the Lotus Flower<br />
</strong>The old orchard in the mountain is not your
home.<br />
You are aware that where you should not be
living, there you make a living.<br />
Mandarin ducks are beaten to disperse in
the lotus pond.<br />
Catkins from the reeds are flying in the
wind.<br />
Wild goose is flying.<br />
Some branches bear fruit.<br />
Many things to do and yet they are not done.<br />
To be successful you need help from someone
who is dressed in red.<br />
It is like the decayed tree in spring
budding again.</p>
