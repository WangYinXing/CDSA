<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is like the auspicious dragon&#8217;s
head with the inauspicious snake&#8217;s tail. It is a destiny that offends the
Retreating Spirit. Wealth meets the Exhausting Spirit and you cannot retain
money. Your character is outspoken and frank. When you fail in the beginning, you
will find success in the end. Husband and wife get success early together. Siblings
betray each other.&nbsp; You try hard to
develop business, yet wealth is not retained and there is a lot of wasted
effort. If you want to be successful wait until you reach sixty years of age.</p>
<strong><br clear="all" />
</strong>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Looks like a fisherman&#8217;s house in
waters misty,<br />
Your
home is in the five lakes and four seas.<br />
Withdraw
fishing rod and net, when wind drops, waves calmer,<br />
Enjoy
life in a picturesque place of white and red flowers.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
In worldly matters, much sincerity, pour in plenty of energy.<br />
After many comings and goings, many times
you get the glory.<br />
Looking back to see beyond clouds, there the
wide skies.<br />
Stop fishing pull out the net and enjoy the
rest of your life.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
When the tree is under attack of gusts and heavy rain,<br />
Pair of mandarin ducks need to decide, fly
or not to fly?<br />
Eventually, mandarin ducks are all over the
pond with plant life.<br />
When bright moon shines over fishing bank,
the dim stars in short supply.</p>
<p>Children: <br />
Flowers blossom on the tree,<br />
In autumn, fruits left, there&#8217;re three.<br />
Outside your door a branch, a phoenix son
when you&#8217;re old,<br />
Who brings glory to your family, praise to
your household.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Who believes there is so much danger in those years?<br />
One unpredictable event brings concerns and
fears.<br />
A lot of regrets on the mountain and with
flowing streams,<br />
The restaurant, where good times were had,
no longer seen.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Rain Battering the Lotus Flower<br />
</strong>The old orchard in the mountain is not your
home.<br />
You are aware that where you should not be
living, there you make a living.<br />
Mandarin ducks are beaten to disperse in
the lotus pond.<br />
Catkins from the reeds are flying in the
wind.<br />
Wild goose is flying.<br />
Some branches bear fruit.<br />
Many things to do and yet they are not done.<br />
To be successful you need help from someone
who is dressed in red.<br />
It is like the decayed tree in spring
budding again.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “This life is like the auspicious dragon’s head with the inauspicious snake’s tail,” means that your luck fluctuates throughout life. “It is a destiny that offends the Retreating Spirit,” implies that you can battle against setbacks. “Wealth meets the Exhausting Spirit,” suggests that it is easy for you to overspend. You will eventually succeed.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Looks like a fisherman’s house in waters misty, your home is in the five lakes and four seas,” suggests that your home is anywhere near water, by a lake or by the sea. “Withdraw fishing rod and net, when wind drops, waves calmer,” means when the difficulties you faced are over, you can relax.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    Because you work hard, you eventually get recognition for your achievements. You can take it easy (“stop fishing pull out the net”) at some point and be more leisurely.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    As a couple you need to decide whether or not to relocate (“fly or not fly”) when you are in difficult circumstances (“under attack of gusts and heavy rain”). Eventually, you settle down somewhere pleasant (“pond with plant life”) and enjoy life (“bright moon”).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Three sons (fruits) are predicted. In your late years, there could be an unexpected son (phoenix son), who turns out to be outstanding. For followers, amongst your many followers there will be some who are highly capable.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    When you look back on your life, there were challenging times and many happy memories.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The old orchard in the mountain is not your home,” suggests that you need to find a new home, possibly away from your ancestral home. You can do business, or develop a career, in a location different from where you live. “Mandarin ducks are beaten to disperse in the lotus pond,” implies that as a couple you relocated. “Catkins from the reeds are flying in the wind,” implies that the season is autumn. In your later years (autumn years) you are travelling (“wild goose is flying”). “Some branches bear fruit,” means some of your ventures work out. If you have the support of a benefactor (“someone who is dressed in red”) you can find success. There could be new developments for growing an established business in decline (“decayed tree in spring budding again”).
