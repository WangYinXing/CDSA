<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>You are born straightforward and quick in
action. Although you are bold in taking up responsibility, you are never bold
without careful planning. When others give you flattery, you should not give in
to flowery words. You believe in always standing upright. Unfortunately, what
you get in return are complaints and resentments.&nbsp; In working hard for everything it can bring
lawsuits and gossip.&nbsp; Out of the kindness
of your heart, you carry another person across the river in your boat. What you
get in return are hassles and worries.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Carriage
has turned over, so you have to put it upright again.<br />
When
you&#8217;re lost, the path is difficult to walk on, don&#8217;t lament.<br />
Good
friends will come to bring you to the capital city.<br />
Where
the world is at your feet, you worked successfully.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Noble people join you and lead you in right direction.<br />
Repeated wealth, repeated glory, you make
it happen.<br />
Spend time on mountains with water for your
enjoyment.<br />
Swallows and nightingales, romance has time
limitation.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Like changing the key to play another melody,<br />
Change your spouse another you&#8217;ll marry.<br />
Cannot play the right note with an impure
string,<br />
It&#8217;s not like the old song, you&#8217;re used to
playing.<br />
Just watch out for the bright moon in the cool
breeze at night.<br />
Cries from crane and baboon sound like complaining.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
After rain and wind not many flowers blooming.<br />
In autumn, there
will be three fruits hanging.<br />
Some are unripe
and some are ripening.<br />
Mulberry trees
under the moon, hear cuckoo crowing.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
When Rabbit runs and Rooster crows, obstacles to overcome.<br />
In late spring, moon sets to hide behind
mountains.<br />
After difficulty, you&#8217;re like an old goose
feeling melancholy.<br />
Better to learn Buddhist philosophy and do
deeds for charity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Monkey Playing in Pine Forest<br />
</strong>After the rain, the mountains are beautiful.<br />
When the clouds fly away, the full moon is
bright again.<br />
The world is full of beautiful things.<br />
All you need is to have your heart ready
for the beauty of nature.<br />
When the goose has flown to a distant
mountain,<br />
Flowers have gone leaving behind two fresh fruits.<br />
Tiger&#8217;s waist is hurt by a knife.<br />
The ox horn is replaced by the violin bow.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You believe in doing the right thing. Be aware that not all your good deeds will be appreciated.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Carriage has turned over, so you have to put it upright again,” suggests that when things don’t go according to plan, you will fix any problems. “Good friends will come to bring you to the capital city,” implies that you will get support to reach the headquarters or centre of influence, which is not necessarily the capital.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    Due to the help from good people you can find success again and again. Being outdoors and appreciating nature (“spend time on mountains with water for your enjoyment”) is preferable to getting involved in short-lived, romantic entanglements (“swallows and nightingales, romance has time limitation”).
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    A second marriage might not compare to your first (“Cannot play the right note with an impure string, it’s not like the old song, you’re used to playing”). There are good times (“bright moon in the cool breeze”), yet there are also grumbles (“Cries from crane and baboon sound like complaining”).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    You might face challenges when it comes to having children (“After rain and wind not many flowers blooming”). It is predicted that you will eventually have three children. Some of your children turn out to be outstanding. For followers, you attract some who are mediocre and some who are highly talented.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Rabbit or Rooster years are likely to bring challenges. “In late spring, moon sets to hide behind mountains,” suggests that when you are a young adult you face difficulties. Instead of feeling sorry for yourself, it would benefit you to adopt a philosophical attitude and to create good karma by being charitable.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    After handling troubles, you feel hopeful again (“After the rain, the mountains are beautiful. When the clouds fly away, the full moon is bright again,”). You will do worthwhile things and leave a legacy (“When the goose has flown to a distant mountain, flowers have gone leaving behind two fresh fruits”). “Tiger’s waist is hurt by a knife. The ox horn is replaced by the violin bow,” suggests you might die in glory. The ox horn was used to make receptacles for wine, like wine glasses. During a formal dinner, people drink from the ox horn then they watch musicians play their instruments with a bow (similar to a violin). The end of the dinner (“ox horn is replaced by the violin bow”) is a metaphor for the end of life, with a dramatic and glorious ending (“Tiger’s waist is hurt by a knife”).
