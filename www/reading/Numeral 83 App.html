<p><strong>Destiny<br />
</strong>You are born straightforward and quick in
action. Although you are bold in taking up responsibility, you are never bold
without careful planning. When others give you flattery, you should not give in
to flowery words. You believe in always standing upright. Unfortunately, what
you get in return are complaints and resentments.&nbsp; In working hard for everything it can bring
lawsuits and gossip.&nbsp; Out of the kindness
of your heart, you carry another person across the river in your boat. What you
get in return are hassles and worries.</p>
