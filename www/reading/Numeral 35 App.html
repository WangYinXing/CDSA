<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>You are all on your own and you have to
make an extra effort.&nbsp; All your relatives
can only offer you void assistance and your siblings cannot offer anything
substantial.&nbsp; Those who are truthful to
you are rare.&nbsp; Onlookers, to see how you
fail, are plentiful.&nbsp; You have to suffer
a lot from the wind and frost, and to taste all the bitterness and worries.&nbsp; When your luck has yet to come, whatever you
do is in vain. When you are unprepared, you will meet a noble person, then
sparks light up the cold ashes. The future will be bright. No need to long for
home, wherever you find pleasant is your home.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Background
is a good family,<br />
Maybe
even famous ancestors.<br />
The past
is the past, it&#8217;s history.<br />
Create
own fortune is what matters,<br />
Even ditches
can become bright rivers.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
In Dragon and Tiger years you will
prosper,<br />
Walking
on the path made of jade and gold.<br />
When you reflect on the past, tales retold,<br />
Many good memories you picture.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Pear blossoms blow away in the wind
and rain,<br />
Relationships
come and go, time and again.<br />
In the west
garden a lot of plum and peach trees,<br />
Even
though mountain is full of plants, in the end you&#8217;re lonely.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
One daughter, two sons arrive easily.<br />
A good son like an
immortal peach<br />
In a fragrant
garden so pretty,<br />
Across it blows
spring breeze.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Tiger and Monkey years it is time to go<br />
Seek new ventures in the jade capital.<br />
Meet the emperor in the year of the Rooster,<br />
An important post assigned then you
prosper.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Peach and Plum Trees are Glorious<br />
</strong>In the Yellow River there is water for you
to sail.<br />
However, the water does not flow smoothly.<br />
Phoenix flies out to the red mountain. The
cloud is obstructing its flight path.<br />
Wild geese fly over the wilderness in
autumn.<br />
Rooster crowing and you won&#8217;t find it
peaceful.<br />
The crane on the pine tree is full of freedom.<br />
When the flower withers the fruit appears,
when what is beautiful disappears what is rewarding appears.<br />
Take it easy, because in this life things
come and go many times.</p>
