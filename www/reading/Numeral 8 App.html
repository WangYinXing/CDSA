<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>Out of an ordinary bird&#8217;s nest get a
phoenix.&nbsp; Like getting a pearl out of a
clam, you come from the grassroots to have great achievement.&nbsp; It is suitable to leave your hometown for you
cannot follow father&#8217;s profession.&nbsp;
However, you can carve your own career.&nbsp;
You heart is most kind, yet your well meaning words can come across as
blunt in speech.&nbsp; You tend to be relaxed
about big things, yet you stress about small things.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is always something on your mind.&nbsp; You experience difficulty in the beginning
and prosperity in the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
A piece of metal can be hammered into
shape.<br />
There are plants that grow on rocks.<br />
A wealthy family with a majestic home,<br />
Will help you establish a career of your
own.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Rat year and Ox year are lucky times.<br />
You can
reach the phoenix pond,<br />
Where political
power can be gained,<br />
And
prosperity obtained.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Musical instruments are dusty, due to
lack of play.<br />
How sad
that your young spouse passed away.<br />
Other
opportunities cannot compare,<br />
To those
happy, early days of tender loving care.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
The tree blows in the wind,<br />
One
fruit falls to the ground.<br />
What do Goat
or Dog years bring?<br />
Birth of
your only offspring.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Goat years and Dog years are lucky,
most promising.<br />
You get
good views of the vast territory with Ren and Ding.<br />
Steer
your boat with the wind to get to where you are going.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Moon Hiding Behind Clouds<br />
</strong>The moon is bright, the clouds are dark.<br />
The wind blows into the big river, making
waves, unsettling the water.<br />
You have to prepare for becoming successful
out of many failures.<br />
Be careful, when you catch a pair of carps,
for you only get one.<br />
Like lightning, the shimmering candle cannot
regain light.<br />
The body is stable, heart is unsettled.<br />
When you ask what does the setting sun look
like?<br />
It is like the petals falling onto the path
in the evening wind.<br />
When you need to work hard, don&#8217;t complain.<br />
When you have some success don&#8217;t boast.<br />
At age seventy-two you can count the
flowers under the moon in spring,<br />
For then you will find out just how much
success you have.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can overcome challenges to become successful. You would be better off not to be involved in a family business or to follow the same career as your parents.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    Just as “a piece of metal can be hammered into shape”, you can create a new self-image. You can thrive under challenging circumstances, like “plants that grow on rocks”. There will be mentors who can help you establish your career.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    To reach “phoenix pond” means you can reach the top of your field. You can be influential as well as being affluent.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    When a couple play musical instruments together it is symbolic of a harmonious marriage. “Musical instruments are dusty” alludes to a couple not being together. In the olden days this was usually due to the early death of the spouse. In modern times, it can be due to a relationship break-up. You will have other romantic opportunities, yet you will tend to hanker for your first love.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Fruits refer to children. You are most likely to have a child in a Goat or Dog year. 
    For followers, you can meet a loyal follower in a Goat or Dog year.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    It is a good idea to make plans during Ren years or Ding years. Ren years are those ending with digit 2 (e.g. 1992, 2002, 2012, 2022). Ding years are those ending with digit 7 (e.g. 1997, 2007, 2017, 2027). “Steer your boat with the wind” can mean you need to keep up the pace with your plans, or it can mean to go with the flow
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    Be mindful of problems, “dark clouds” coming during good times, “bright moon”. There could be some ups and downs. You have to prepare for becoming successful out of many failures. Be aware that there will be times when you don’t get everything you expect. You will be able to look back on a successful life.
