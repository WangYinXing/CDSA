<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>
This life is full of gossip and unpalatable
rumors, which are hard to swallow. You are kind-hearted and your words are
quite frank because you don&#8217;t hide anything. There is no way you are going to
change your mind because of another&#8217;s opinions. You will not lose out to
others. Life is not straightforward for you and you often wander about and go
the long way round. Money comes from the east and goes to the west, readily
passing through your hands. It is suitable for you to marry late and have
children late. There will be sons followed by daughters. You like to learn a
lot, yet your understanding is not profound. Despite making a lot of plans, not
many will be followed through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Controversy is with you, with you
lifelong.<br />
You&#8217;re
like pine tree and bamboo, straight and strong.<br />
Doing
the right thing is what success depends upon.<br />
Eventually,
fame and fortune will come along.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Trying to make the first move, like a hero.<br />
On heavenly mountain, shoot three arrows,<br />
For that is how your accomplishments grow.<br />
You can enjoy the beauty of mountains and
rivers,<br />
All because you placed many bookmarks of
plum flowers.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
The wedding was a long time ago.<br />
In the
beginning get along well as a couple.<br />
As time
moves on, feel less content,<br />
Maybe
some regrets in the end.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Just after the rain, flowers bloom in
fine weather.<br />
Good
fruits are expected, thereafter.<br />
Petals
blown away by night winds,<br />
The
prospect of many fruits rescinds.<br />
Only one
tree with leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
The time to go maybe Rooster or Monkey.<br />
Bing and Ding years are full of gossip so
nosy.<br />
Leave the city to retire in the country,<br />
Find a quiet place with lots of trees.<br />
Bring a fishing rod to fish peacefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Pine and Cedar Glorious at the Same Time<br />
</strong>Take leave of your hometown.<br />
Like the pine and bamboo you can withstand
the extremes of hot and cold.<br />
Wild goose flies away and leaves the flock
early.<br />
You may even part with your spouse early.<br />
When the moon is at mid-sky clouds will
disperse.<br />
Over the pavilion you can enjoy the
beautiful flowers,<br />
Because the east wind blows several times,
to bring the fairy from paradise to pick you up.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Money comes from the east and goes to the west”, means you can make money, yet it is easily spent, therefore it would be a good idea to manage your finances carefully. Make an effort to bring your plans to completion.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Like pine tree and bamboo, straight and strong” means you can be outspoken and this attracts controversy.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can take the initiative (“Trying to make the first move, like a hero”) and you have the talent to succeed (“On heavenly mountain, shoot three arrows”). You can find yourself in elegant surroundings (“beauty of mountains and rivers”), which implies you can be successful. The secret of your success is that you studied a lot and became well educated (“placed many bookmarks of plum flowers).
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can have a long marriage. Avoid saying or doing anything you might regret.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Just after rain, flowers bloom in fine weather. Good fruits are expected, thereafter” suggests that it looks promising for lots of children in the beginning. “Petals blown away by night winds, the prospect of many fruits rescind” implies that you might have fewer children than imagine. The number of children/followers you have is pre-destined.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The time to go is maybe Rooster or Monkey” suggests that Rooster or Monkey years or months might be significant if you want to go somewhere. Bing years are years ending with the digit 6 , e.g. 1996, 2006, 2016, 2026 etc. Ding years follow Bing years, so Ding years end with digit 7, e.g. 1997, 2007, 2017, 2027, etc. You encounter gossip in Bing and Ding years. “Bring a fishing rod to fish peacefully” suggests you will enjoy a quiet retirement.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    When you leave your hometown you are strong enough to handle any ups and downs (“like the pine and bamboo, you can withstand the extremes of hot and cold”). You can do your own thing and stand out from the crowd at a young age (“Wild goose flies away and leaves the flock early”). Misfortune will fade (“When the moon is at mid-sky clouds will disperse”) and you can enjoy good fortune (“Over the pavilion you can enjoy the beautiful flowers”). When you are in difficulties, you will have good luck (east wind) and there is someone coming to your rescue.
