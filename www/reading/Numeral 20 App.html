<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This life is full of gossip and unpalatable
rumors, which are hard to swallow. You are kind-hearted and your words are
quite frank because you don&#8217;t hide anything. There is no way you are going to
change your mind because of another&#8217;s opinions. You will not lose out to
others. Life is not straightforward for you and you often wander about and go
the long way round. Money comes from the east and goes to the west, readily
passing through your hands. It is suitable for you to marry late and have
children late. There will be sons followed by daughters. You like to learn a
lot, yet your understanding is not profound. Despite making a lot of plans, not
many will be followed through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Controversy is with you, with you
lifelong.<br />
You&#8217;re
like pine tree and bamboo, straight and strong.<br />
Doing
the right thing is what success depends upon.<br />
Eventually,
fame and fortune will come along.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Trying to make the first move, like a hero.<br />
On heavenly mountain, shoot three arrows,<br />
For that is how your accomplishments grow.<br />
You can enjoy the beauty of mountains and
rivers,<br />
All because you placed many bookmarks of
plum flowers.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
The wedding was a long time ago.<br />
In the
beginning get along well as a couple.<br />
As time
moves on, feel less content,<br />
Maybe
some regrets in the end.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Just after the rain, flowers bloom in
fine weather.<br />
Good
fruits are expected, thereafter.<br />
Petals
blown away by night winds,<br />
The
prospect of many fruits rescinds.<br />
Only one
tree with leaves and flowers.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
The time to go maybe Rooster or Monkey.<br />
Bing and Ding years are full of gossip so
nosy.<br />
Leave the city to retire in the country,<br />
Find a quiet place with lots of trees.<br />
Bring a fishing rod to fish peacefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Pine and Cedar Glorious at the Same Time<br />
</strong>Take leave of your hometown.<br />
Like the pine and bamboo you can withstand
the extremes of hot and cold.<br />
Wild goose flies away and leaves the flock
early.<br />
You may even part with your spouse early.<br />
When the moon is at mid-sky clouds will
disperse.<br />
Over the pavilion you can enjoy the
beautiful flowers,<br />
Because the east wind blows several times,
to bring the fairy from paradise to pick you up.</p>
