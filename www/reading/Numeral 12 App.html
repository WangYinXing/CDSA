<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life has a lot of regrets, but if you
take it easy you can enjoy leisure. When you want to walk, fate tells you to
stand still.&nbsp; When you want to come
inside, fate tells you to go away.&nbsp;
Destiny opposes your wishes, nothing is smooth.&nbsp; After advancing you retreat, one step
forwards, two steps back. You like to learn a lot, but your understanding is
not profound.&nbsp; In the beginning you are
as fierce as a tiger, in the end you are quite motionless, like a dead snake
curled on the floor. Your enthusiasm for things does not last and you do not
always finish what you start. Do not ask for too many favors, and do not take on
board other&#8217;s criticism. Whatever appears to be malevolent turns out to be not that
nasty.&nbsp; Whatever appears to be fortunate turns
out to be not that promising.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
On meeting noble people, they will
point out the path you should be taking.<br />
You are
a person who is most upstanding.<br />
During Tiger or Dragon years good friends you will make, &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br />
In Dog
and Goat years opportunities turn up for you to take.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
You have
to walk a thousand miles.<br />
Even if
exhausted, you have to go on,<br />
To find the job or take the exam.<br />
Wait until you can ride the horse to see
the results,<br />
Ox and Goat years will bring good rewards.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Like
mandarin ducks you make good companions.<br />
Even
though your characters are not so similar,<br />
Able to overcome
difficulties together,<br />
Enduring
biting winds and cold frosts bitter.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
The poor grass is under attack,<br />
From wild
wind and heavy rain.<br />
Yet
there are two fruits and flowers.<br />
Youngest son is the one who is clever.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
As you build
up a career, not much support from friends.<br />
Spring
is over, yet you cannot stay until the banquet ends.<br />
You look
back to see the setting sun, the clouds are beautiful, captivating.<br />
Spend
your final days like the lonely goose flying in the west wind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Goose Flying over Beautiful Marsh<br />
</strong>When you
are enjoying good luck, beware of bad luck coming suddenly.<br />
You are
as upright as a pine tree.<br />
The clouds
will hide behind mountains at night.<br />
Green
willow buds will give rise to a new branch.<br />
What you
built originally will form a good basis for taking hold of new opportunities.<br />
In the
autumn, a pair of wild geese fly together.<br />
In the
end, on a sand dune, a lone mandarin duck without a companion.<br />
Thunder
arouses the Dragon and the Snake.<br />
Rain and
dew, Ox and Goat, will come when the time is right.&nbsp;<br />
A good
salary and acquiring property will happen in their own time.<br />
Your character
is like clear water.<br />
During
your younger years you are quite a romantic person, like the mandarin ducks
playing in the water.<br />
In old
age, you can enjoy life, with lots of gold bars and plum blossoms.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    By taking a relaxed approach, you can enjoy life. Do not let circumstances or other people’s disapproval put you off from pursuing your goals.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Noble people” are helpful people you encounter when you need guidance. Tiger, Dragon, Dog and Goat years can be lucky times.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Wait until you can ride the horse” suggests that you need to wait for the right time. You might need to work hard until the time is right.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can find a good match in someone who has a different character to your own. “Enduring biting winds and cold frosts bitter” means you are able to get through hard times as a couple.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Two fruits and some flowers” means you can have two sons (fruits) and some daughters (flowers). The “wild wind and heavy rain” suggests that having children is not straightforward. You can have many followers. The most capable followers come later.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Spring refers to the time of your youth. To not be able to “stay until the banquet ends” suggests that you might not be able to make the most of all the opportunities that come your way. However, when you look back on your life “the clouds are beautiful and captivating” implies that you would be able to look back on many good times, even if you are on your own.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “You are as upright as a pine tree,” means you have a honourable character.  Beware of bad luck coming suddenly is suggested by “The clouds will hide behind mountains at night”. You can enjoy marital harmony in the mid-to-late years of your life.  “Gold bars and plum blossoms” evoke an image of a wealthy and leisurely lifestyle.
