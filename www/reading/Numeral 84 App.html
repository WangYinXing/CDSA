<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is like the moon being blocked by
the clouds, it is like a mirror covered in dust. You think hard and make plans
to work hands-on without relying on others, working independently. The
relationship between you and your relatives are like that of burning charcoal
and ice. They cannot be brought together for charcoal melts ice and ice puts
out the burning charcoal. Brothers-in-law cannot co-operate with you. At home you
are bickering all the time, yet outside you are very happy. The melon is sweet,
but it grows from a bitter stalk. Nothing is perfect in life. You are rowing a
sampan in the high seas when the waves are dangerous and the wind is strong. Whether
it is worries or happiness, it all washes over your heart. Don&#8217;t complain about
having to work hard. The time for enjoyment is at hand.</p>
<p>Chinese goldthread<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;and licorice are different parts of the same plant. Sweetness and bitterness
are from the same source.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You overcome a lot of obstacles (“the moon being blocked by clouds” and “mirror covered in dust”). Life has both joy and sadness.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Hold a bow and arrow to shoot in cardinal and inter-cardinal directions,” suggests that you are well prepared and can handle various situations. “There will come a day for military accomplishment” implies that you will achieve your goals in an organised manner. “Military accomplishment” suggests achievement because of a well-disciplined approach, and is not necessarily related to being in the military.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Find your way to the gate of the earl’s castle,” means you will be awarded a title. You create good karma by doing charitable deeds and gain a fortune as a result. Phoenix pavilion and dragon terrace refer to glamorous places where the rich and famous spend time. You are likely to be found in these places when you are successful.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are likely to experience ups and downs in your marriage. In your later (“twilight”) years you can appreciate the good points about your relationship, as well as noticing the flaws.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Children are predicted, although you might experience challenges (“overnight rain”) when it comes to having children. You strive to give your children a good education (“prop and prune fruits in cultivation”). For followers, you will train them well.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Wild flowers full of dew, around the fence thrive,” suggests that you can make a success of the opportunities that come in Dragon years and Monkey years. Even though you prosper (“red cinnamon, green pine, bamboo cover the mountain”) you might still be searching for what is meaningful in life (“crane and monkey feel empty under the setting moon”).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are hopeful (“when the clouds are hiding, the moon is at mid-sky”) and determined (“When it snows on the lonely pine tree, it stands out in firmness”). Destiny will have you stay where you were meant to stay (“When the wild geese fly over the giant reeds, are they destined to stay?”). You face challenges in the south (“Li Palace”), and in the west (“Dui Palace”). “Refine and polish the gold with an unchanging heart” means you persist with your goals. Underneath it all, you are still yourself (“I am myself like the old green blankets”).
