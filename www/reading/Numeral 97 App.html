<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>n this life you believe in being fair.
Born with a stable character, you will not say black is white. You can
distinguish between the white and the green. You have control over the ignoble
people and you can get close to the honorable people. You admire and respect
the noble people. You love to learn and want to be-friend the nice people. Because
you are not that determined, people who are failures are jealous of you. With
an ability to keep secrets inside your bosom, other people cannot guess what is
on your mind.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Never mind the wins, losses and
difficulties.<br />
When you have great and bright ambition,<br />
Success depends on your determination.<br />
Fortunately, there is a road leading to
glory,<br />
Borrow a friend&#8217;s status to start this
journey.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Horse
year will bring you good tidings.<br />
In Goat
and Dog years, ease in everything.<br />
Fly over
to a distant land, without knowing,<br />
A boss
from a past life you will be meeting<sup>1</sup>.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Pair of mandarin ducks back to back in the
rain, they&#8217;re standing.<br />
In late years, to play with you in the sand
dunes, friends are coming.<br />
With a companion to hold your hand in front
of the screen of your door,<br />
Don&#8217;t try to pretend to be a great lover
going all over the place, therefore.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
In both gardens, cinnamon blossoms.<br />
There will be a fruit, wait till autumn.<br />
Having done many good deeds for charity,<br />
In late years, you can avoid being lonely.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Stay away from drinking and romance, stay well away.<br />
All because these things will lead to tears
later one day.<br />
Then look into the past, no particular
danger, nothing risky.<br />
Withered branch of tree blossoms again with
greater beauty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Pine Tree on the Rock<br />
</strong>The pine tree is reaching the sky when it
is old.<br />
Stiff and strong, it is not afraid of the
attack by snow and frost.<br />
You shoulder the tons of heavy loads all by
yourself.<br />
Then you will be peaceful and can enjoy
your heart&#8217;s content.<br />
You will not tell lies or make yourself
mysterious.<br />
You can see far beyond but you do not boast
about your ability.<br />
Whether you will be poor or rich is all
down to destiny.<br />
Don&#8217;t admire the foolish people who are
blessed with the full house of gold.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Footnote 1<br />
A boss from a past
life will seek you out in the present life because you did a good job
before.&nbsp; The boss will be able to find
you. You do not need to do any searching yourself.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    White refers to what is right and black signifies what is wrong. In between black and white there are shades of gray, when things are not clearly right or wrong. To “not say black is white” means you will not say something is right, when you know it is wrong. “You can distinguish between the white and the green,” is like saying you can tell the difference between white and shades of gray.

<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    An influential friend can help you in your career. You need to persist in pursuing your goals.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    The idea of “a boss from a past life” is tied to reincarnation. In a previous life, a boss was pleased with your work. In this lifetime, his reincarnated self looks for your reincarnated self to work together again.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Pair of mandarin ducks back to back in the rain, they’re standing,” suggests that you encounter problems in your relationship. It would be wise to be loyal to your spouse.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Children are predicted (“cinnamon blossoms”), and a son (“fruit”) is likely to arrive late in your life (“autumn”). You create good karma through charitable acts, therefore your children will keep you company when you are old.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Withered branch of tree blossoms again with greater beauty,” suggests that you are still fortunate in your later years.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You have the stamina and ability to handle difficulties throughout life.
