</strong>You are born under a star that brings you
big opportunities during times of change.&nbsp;
It is like the wind and the clouds coming together auspiciously, and you
can have great accomplishment when the world around you is shifting.&nbsp; The stars that rule your destiny also bring
you harmonious relationships with your superiors.&nbsp; You abhor unethical people and do not
tolerate their appalling behavior. &nbsp;When
misfortune strikes you know how to handle the situation.&nbsp; You go forwards rather than hide and you can
stay in control.&nbsp; Like a bird carefully
building a bird&#8217;s nest, twig by twig, you care about your relatives throughout
life.&nbsp; Imperfect planning and a lack of
motivation can hamper your efforts.&nbsp; Constantly
on the move, you can travel around a lot.&nbsp;
In this life, it is easy come, easy go for you, and there are a lot of
changes. Your spouse tends to be vulnerable to the ups and downs of life.&nbsp; It is most suitable for you to leave your
hometown to establish a life outside for yourself.</p>

<p><strong>Style:
Two Lotus Leaves Covering the Water<br />
</strong>When you
start out, you are barefoot, yet you know you can look to the future.<br />
Like a lotus
coming out of muddy pond, with no mud adhered to it, you are not smeared by
mud.<br />
You can
adapt to changes in this world to make a good living.<br />
Whether
you use your physical or mental abilities, you have to work hard and career
success comes late.<br />
Wild
geese flying in formation breaks up the clouds, they come together and disperse.<br />
Mandarin
ducks argue and separate.<br />
If you
want to know what is happening in your life,<br />
Ask the
cloud to lend you a ladder to reach the moon.<br />
No need to ask, get on with your life.</p>
