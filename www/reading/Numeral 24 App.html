<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt; word-spacing: 0pt;">In this life you are close to noble people
and you can get the blessings from the emperor. When you go out you will encounter
the good winds and the good clouds.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
the five elements are mixed and confused, the situation is not clear. It is
like in autumn when the leaves are falling down.&nbsp; There is limited support from your family and
you will be wasting your time being on the wrong path.&nbsp; It would be a good idea to choose a career
that is calm and undemanding, one that is not so competitive. However, when you
want to find an easy job, you cannot. It might seem like an easy job, but there
is always something bothering you. When you have fame and fortune, be careful
for you might lose it. You have to pay back a lot of karmic debt and encounter
a lot of wind and frost, difficult circumstances. You speak your mind and don&#8217;t
hide your feelings. When you want to do something, you don&#8217;t have patience to
wait. Whatever you do appears to be quite adept, but unfortunately it comes out
as inept. Clumsiness comes out from being skillful. What is right often gives
birth to what is wrong. About money, when it comes, it comes like the clouds
brought by the wind. When it goes, it goes like the river running into the sea.&nbsp; Fortunately, you are like the peach blossom
with a thousand leaves, it has a good appearance but it is not fruitful.&nbsp; Success or failure, are just like empty dreams.&nbsp; You can enjoy looking at the willow blossom,
but you cannot eat it like you can eat the papaya. You can keep up appearances
but it is not always practical.</span></p>

achievement and glory.<br />

and becomes successful in both places.<br />

way to go</p>
