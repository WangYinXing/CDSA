<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt; word-spacing: 0pt;">In this life you are close to noble people
and you can get the blessings from the emperor. When you go out you will encounter
the good winds and the good clouds.&nbsp; Unfortunately,
the five elements are mixed and confused, the situation is not clear. It is
like in autumn when the leaves are falling down.&nbsp; There is limited support from your family and
you will be wasting your time being on the wrong path.&nbsp; It would be a good idea to choose a career
that is calm and undemanding, one that is not so competitive. However, when you
want to find an easy job, you cannot. It might seem like an easy job, but there
is always something bothering you. When you have fame and fortune, be careful
for you might lose it. You have to pay back a lot of karmic debt and encounter
a lot of wind and frost, difficult circumstances. You speak your mind and don&#8217;t
hide your feelings. When you want to do something, you don&#8217;t have patience to
wait. Whatever you do appears to be quite adept, but unfortunately it comes out
as inept. Clumsiness comes out from being skillful. What is right often gives
birth to what is wrong. About money, when it comes, it comes like the clouds
brought by the wind. When it goes, it goes like the river running into the sea.&nbsp; Fortunately, you are like the peach blossom
with a thousand leaves, it has a good appearance but it is not fruitful.&nbsp; Success or failure, are just like empty dreams.&nbsp; You can enjoy looking at the willow blossom,
but you cannot eat it like you can eat the papaya. You can keep up appearances
but it is not always practical.</span></p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    To get “blessings from the emperor” means you can gain support from those in positions of authority. To “encounter the good winds and good clouds” implies you can find yourself in favorable circumstances. However, even when you find yourself in a fortunate situation, everything (“the five elements”) can be chaotic. “It is like in autumn when the leaves are falling down,” suggests that the timing might be such that you arrive after the best time. Money can come and go for you. You can appear successful like a “peach blossom with a thousand leaves”, even though you might not amass great wealth (“not fruitful”).
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    It can be hard work to manage your inheritance. Avoid being arrogant and remain flexible when it comes to pursuing your goals.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “If your musical talent is appreciated, by someone you meet, then sing a song” means your talents (any talents, not necessarily musical) can be valued by someone you meet in a faraway place. You can make a name for yourself because you get the opportunity to demonstrate your capabilities.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You might be tempted to think you are incompatible with your spouse when you face challenges in your relationship. However, if you are patient you can resolve matters and share good times.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can have a son after having three or four daughters. Your children can be successful and independent. For followers, you will have more female followers than male followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Whilst Ox and Horse years can be fortunate times, yet Dog years are not. When you have overcome adversity (“wind dies down and the waves are peaceful”) you realise that your life is quite stable (“your boat is stable”, “sail into the woods”).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Leave your hometown in the west to go live in the east” means it is suitable for you to move far away from your hometown, the directions are not to be taken literally. Sometimes, if you let things be they will turn out better than if you try too hard (“Grow willow in the south garden, yet the north garden is more pristine”). “The chicken follows the turkey early in spring to look for worms” implies that when you are young, it would pay off to follow in the footsteps of someone who knows where to look for rewards. “Swallow robs the nightingale of its nest and becomes successful in both places” suggests that there can be success if you leave behind what you already have and compete elsewhere. To “follow the clouds, rivers and moon” suggests you go with the flow and do what is the easiest thing to do.
