<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life enjoys all the good things from
the five elements. Your good fortune comes from everything being right. Your
powerful words like thunder, which can arouse somebody from their dreams.&nbsp; With vital energy that is strong and
flexible, you have many ideas and make plans with a lot of depth. Although you
learn a lot of different subjects, you are not an expert in any of them. At the
start you are full of enthusiasm and great at beginning new things, but you do
not finish everything.&nbsp; Whatever you
touch, you have to use your mind.&nbsp; Even
though you do not mean to, your impatient words can hurt and offend people. You
have a kind heart and are well meaning, yet it brings nothing but enemies and
complaints.&nbsp; Your spouse has a resilient
constitution and can withstand illness. Retirement will start in Tiger year or
Rat year.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
You usually have a plan that is good.<br />
Unfortunately
it is always difficult, that must be understood.<br />
So you
have to go a long way from where you are,<br />
As a fisherman,
woodcutter or someone who travels far.<br />
When it
comes, enjoy a good retirement, as you should.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Travel everywhere and have an amazing
time.<br />
At the

Ox, fortune will turn up and so will fame.<br />
Horse
year, Ox year bring good news and a good name.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
After the wedding, you start married
life.<br />
On the
beautiful mountain, a family you will establish.<br />
Devotion
and loyalty you will accomplish.<br />
A wonderful romance for husband and wife.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
One daughter and five sons in all.<br />
Maybe

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
White Jade Leaving the Dust<br />
</strong>Time does not wait, you will age easily.<br />
The melancholy of autumn is what you are
facing.<br />
Weather is unstable with rain and clouds
moving along.<br />
Under the strong winds, the young flowers
and fruits are at risk, in danger of being damaged.<br />
You get along with the ideas of your
superior, and you please your superiors.<br />
Be careful of being back-stabbed by your
subordinates.<br />
When you are asked which part of your life
is most enjoyable.<br />
It is everywhere while you are travelling.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    The five elements is a way to refer to everything on earth. This is because in Chinese philosophy, everything on earth is classified according to the five elements of wood, fire, earth, metal and water. “All the good things from the five elements” means you can enjoy all the good things on earth. Being careful in your speech can help you avoid problems.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    Usually, you make good plans, yet they are often quite difficult. You pursue a career, which requires a specialised skill and involves travelling.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    During your travels you can meet an inspiring woman close to somewhere near water. Ox years and Horse years will be particularly lucky.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    A long and happy marriage is predicted.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “One outside the wall” alludes to the possibility of a child being born outside of the main family. It could mean a step-child from another relationship, or a child from an affair. For followers, you could attract those who had previously been in another camp.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can be a successful leader (“to hold the flag”). You end your days away from your hometown.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You have eventful life, so time flies by. When you face challenges (“under strong winds”), you can count on your superiors, but watch out for your subordinates.
