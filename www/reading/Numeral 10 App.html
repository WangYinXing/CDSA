<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This life enjoys all the good things from
the five elements. Your good fortune comes from everything being right. Your
powerful words like thunder, which can arouse somebody from their dreams.&nbsp; With vital energy that is strong and
flexible, you have many ideas and make plans with a lot of depth. Although you
learn a lot of different subjects, you are not an expert in any of them. At the
start you are full of enthusiasm and great at beginning new things, but you do
not finish everything.&nbsp; Whatever you
touch, you have to use your mind.&nbsp; Even
though you do not mean to, your impatient words can hurt and offend people. You
have a kind heart and are well meaning, yet it brings nothing but enemies and
complaints.&nbsp; Your spouse has a resilient
constitution and can withstand illness. Retirement will start in Tiger year or
Rat year.</p>

<p><strong>Style:
White Jade Leaving the Dust<br />
</strong>Time does not wait, you will age easily.<br />
The melancholy of autumn is what you are
facing.<br />
Weather is unstable with rain and clouds
moving along.<br />
Under the strong winds, the young flowers
and fruits are at risk, in danger of being damaged.<br />
You get along with the ideas of your
superior, and you please your superiors.<br />
Be careful of being back-stabbed by your
subordinates.<br />
When you are asked which part of your life
is most enjoyable.<br />
It is everywhere while you are travelling.</p>
