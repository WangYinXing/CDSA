<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>In this life the Solitary Star is heavy and
the Retreating Spirit is also heavy. It is most suitable to leave home and
establish your own life, for you cannot rely on your parents to enjoy
prosperity.&nbsp; You need to make a living
overcoming layers and layers of waves. Like an acrobat somersaulting over the
pole at a hundred feet above ground, life can be challenging. Because your Four
Pillars chart is firm, the foundation cannot be shaken.</p>
<strong><br clear="all" />
</strong>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Phoenix pavilion and dragon tower in the capital city.<br />
Come to visit these places, travelling a
long way.<br />
Step on the jade and gold, then re-located
faraway.<br />
When you look from the riverside, your heart
is still in the capital.<br />
You long to be back at headquarters, not in
some outpost.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
The autumn scenery, even though still bright, is quite solitary.<br />
You used to hold power to assist for the
good of the country.<br />
Alas, your services the emperor does not
want to retain.<br />
Near to the centre of power, you&#8217;re anxious
to remain.<br />
Yet, you have to take up a light carriage
off to a new post.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Always in springtime the peach is blossoming.<br />
By the riverside, mandarin ducks are
meeting.<br />
Under the bright autumn moon the shadows
are clear.<br />
Flocks of nightingales and swallows come to
rest on apple trees here.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Fairy peach branch has half green, half yellow fruits hanging.<br />
Flowers in two gardens are most fragrant in
the evening.<br />
There are two branches that are most
flourishing,<br />
Above the earth and under the sky, by the
pond they&#8217;re great looking.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Rabbit is looking for dragon&#8217;s den, a lot of merits accumulating.<br />
In south garden, orchid and cinnamon are flourishing.<br />
It is a great pleasure to be with the
flowers, drinking.<br />
At the sound of the flute, towards the
sandbank, heading.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Nightingale Resting in the Wild Forest.<br />
</strong>There is no need to measure the amount of
gold in the house.<br />
Let others comment on your strengths and
weaknesses.<br />
The lonely wild goose sleeps by the
riverside.<br />
There is an untied boat floating across the
river.<br />
The nightingale sings on the flowering
branch in late spring.<br />
People living in straw huts feel that days are
getting longer and longer.<br />
When you are asked about success and
failure in the past,<br />
There are a lot of beautiful songs singing
farewell to the setting sun.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “In this life the Solitary Star is heavy and the Retreating Spirit is also heavy,” means that being independent is a good choice, and it would prevent others from holding you back. You can overcome various challenges.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You arrive at a prominent organisation (“phoenix pavilion and dragon tower in the capital city”) and gain a prestigious role (“step on jade and gold”). However, after a re-organisation you find yourself relocated out of the headquarters.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The autumn scenery, even though still bright, is quite solitary,” suggests that you are still in a promising position in your later years. Nevertheless, you would prefer to be close to the CEO/leader (“emperor”) and be in an authoritative position helping the company (“country”). Instead you take a journey elsewhere (“take up a light carriage”) for another post.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    A sincere, happy and long-lasting relationship is predicted. Nightingales are symbolic of romance and swallows represent domestic bliss.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Many good-looking children are predicted. For followers, you have many attractive followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You enjoy a good retirement because of your hard work.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “There is no need to measure the amount of gold in the house,” means you are comfortable financially. “The lonely wild goose sleeps by the riverside, “ implies that you like to go your own way without following the crowd. “There is an untied boat floating across the river,” suggests that there might be times when you may feel adrift. “The nightingale sings on the flowering branch in late spring,” infers that romance blossoms towards the end of your youth. “People living in straw huts feel that the days are getting longer and longer,” is not actually referring to other people, it means that when you do not have much to do, you feel somewhat bored. You are popular and a lot of people come to give you praise at the end of your life (“beautiful songs singing farewell to the setting sun”).
