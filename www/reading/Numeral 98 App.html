<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>In this life you can ride the wind. You will
not do anything to deceive yourself. Yet you may be doing nothing substantial.&nbsp; You will not take advantage of others. Although
you are carrying a hidden weapon there is failure within success. When your
business has not shown any success yet, you are starting another new project. Fame
and fortune, failure and success are all like this, starting new ventures
before completion. Then you understand you are born to lead such a life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Start career without ancestors giving you a hand.<br />
Jade is hidden in rocks, gold is in the
sand.<br />
One day the good craftsman starts work with
purpose,<br />
The gold is shining and the jade is
flawless.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Xin year is when you meet noble people.<br />
Flourishing grass and trees indicate a new
home where you&#8217;ll settle.<br />
Fame and fortune lies here, you&#8217;ll be
successful.<br />
Ride a boat and toast to the plum blossom
wonderful.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Sun is shining on beautiful willow
blossom.<br />
Pair of
mandarin ducks fly away, one by one.<br />
In late
years, friends are all around, socializing.<br />
By the
river where the boat is tied, someone is fishing.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Famous garden in spring, flowers blossom.<br />
Hanging on the branch will be fruit in
autumn.<br />
With the help of all your good deeds,<br />
There will be fortune coming freely.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
With Goat and Pig don&#8217;t lament over your wishes becoming empty,<br />
Recollect all the fortunate things in your
life, there are plenty.<br />
The bright moon and cool breeze,<br />
Bring immeasurable beautiful scenery.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Hibiscus Reflected in the Water<br />
</strong>Beautiful hibiscus is making the water red.<br />
It cannot stand the cold rain and wind.<br />
Flower is beautiful but it does not bear
any fruits.<br />
Leaves will shed in no time and everything
becomes an empty dream.<br />
Don&#8217;t laugh at the roots being born in
spring.<br />
It will eventually be placed inside a
beautiful vase.<br />
This is a better ending than the petals that
were blown by autumn wind into the water, floating away.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    To “ride the wind” means you go whichever direction the wind blows, so you tend to live without any specific goals, or your goals constantly change. You can choose to accomplish one goal before pursuing another.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You have hidden talents (“Jade is hidden in rocks, gold is in the sand”) and when your talents are unveiled, you can apply them purposefully (“good craftsman starts work with purpose”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    Xin years are those ending with a digit 1, e.g. 1991, 2001, 2011, 2021. To “ride a boat and toast to the plum blossom wonderful” implies that later in life you will celebrate your success.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Sun is shining on beautiful willow blossom,” suggests good times in a relationship. “Pair of mandarin ducks fly away, one by one,” alludes to a separation. “By the river where the boat is tied, someone is fishing,” imply tranquil times.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Your children will have achievement (“famous garden”). Because you create good karma with your charitable acts, your children enjoy good fortune. For followers, you attract successful ones.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “With Goat and Pig don’t lament over your wishes becoming empty,” implies that Goat years and Pig years might be the times when you feel unfulfilled. If you put things into perspective you have enjoyed a lot of good times (“bright moon and cool breeze”).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    Restrictions in life turn out to be blessings in disguise. Flowers in the vase do not enjoy the same freedom as the flowers growing in the wild, yet the constraint of being in a vase indoors protected them from being blown over by the wind.
