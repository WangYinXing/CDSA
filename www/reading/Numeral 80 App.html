<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>The star of Jade Hall and star of Golden Horse
shine on this life. Wealth is abundant in your life. However, in your later
days the Retreating Spirit is heavy. When you are kind to people, you can expect
them to take advantage of you, because you are very generous. Not everything
brings worries and you don&#8217;t need to frown about such things.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Throughout life, ambition is as high as the sky.<br />
No ladder taking you up to heaven,
unfortunately.<br />
If you ask when will you get fields of
mulberry?<br />
Time of Ox, Dragon, Snake or Horse will be
lucky.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Cuckoo on the branch is complaining about spring leaving.<br />
If you go towards the seaside, there&#8217;ll be
smooth luck in everything.<br />
A lot of people in high places will be
responding.<br />
Phoenix will be on the maple branch, stably
staying.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
On the other side of the world, a beautiful woman.<br />
Transplant peach and apricot, bring faraway
fragrance.<br />
Water fowls are happy together in the pond,
it seems.<br />
Chrysanthemum garden covered by thick
frost, like a dream.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Fairy peach on the branch, cinnamon flowers fragrant.<br />
Half the fruits are hurt and half of them
ripen.<br />
Family wearing red and purple, well worth a
smile,<br />
In your late years, smile is so worthwhile.<br />
Offspring will be holding many high
positions.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
If you want to ask about your luck, when you&#8217;ll be lucky.<br />
Answer will be Dragon, Snake, Rooster, Dog
and Monkey.<br />
Your luck is like the big river flowing
east to the sea,<br />
Colorful sails going back to the
south-east.<br />
Intelligent people sharing wine in your
company.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Re-polishing Your Precious Sword<br />
</strong>The sword is very sharp.<br />
It is pure gold covered up by dust and
soil, it doesn&#8217;t give out brilliance.<br />
Prepare the stone to polish sword again in battlefield
of the Tiger and Dragon.<br />
Brightness from sword shines up to the
Small Dipper star and Cowboy star in the sky.<br />
Flock of wild geese split and reform.<br />
Inside the garden, the flowers blossom
again.<br />
Once the mountain meets the giant eye,<br />
You hear the horse neighing amidst ten
thousand flowers.<br />
Once ability is appreciated, you are placed
on horseback to go into the deep forest to have achievement.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The star of Jade Hall and the star of Golden Horse shine on this life,” implies that you have good wealth luck. Be mindful of setbacks (“Retreating Spirit is heavy”) in your later years. Nevertheless, you have a life without a lot of concerns.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are highly ambitious, yet you might not achieve all the goals you set for yourself. Ox, Dragon, Snake or Horse years are the time for you to gain wealth (“fields of mulberry”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Cuckoo on the branch is complaining about spring leaving,” implies that there is no point in complaining about getting older. “Phoenix will be on the maple branch, stably staying” means good fortune will be stable.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    Someone from a faraway place is highly attractive, and you end up together in a relationship. You can establish a family (“water fowls are happy together in the pond”). The prediction is for a long-lasting marriage (“Chrysanthemum garden covered by thick frost”).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    It is predicted that you will have outstanding children (“fairy peach on the branch, cinnamon flowers fragrant”). Your children will be in influential positions (“wearing red and purple”). For followers, they will be highly capable.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Colourful sails going back to south-east,” refers to Dragon and Snake (these two signs occupy south-east direction). Dragon and Snake times are predicted to be lucky. Dragon and Snake can mean Dragon years and Snake years, or it could be referring to the time of your life when you finish your studies. Monkey, Rooster and Dog represent the autumn season, which can represent the later years or your life. You can also expect good luck in your autumn years or you can be lucky in Monkey years, Rooster years or Dog years. “Your luck is like the big river flowing east to the sea” suggests you have a lot of luck.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You have abilities (“The sword is very sharp”), yet you need to sharpen your skills and make use of them (“polish sword again in the battlefield of the Tiger and Dragon”). Your abilities will be noticed (“Brightness from sword shines up”). After a re-organisation (“wild geese split and reform”) there will be success (“flowers blossom again”). Once your talents are appreciated, you are placed in a position to have great achievement.
