<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>The star of Jade Hall and star of Golden Horse
shine on this life. Wealth is abundant in your life. However, in your later
days the Retreating Spirit is heavy. When you are kind to people, you can expect
them to take advantage of you, because you are very generous. Not everything
brings worries and you don&#8217;t need to frown about such things.</p>

Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Throughout life, ambition is as high as the sky.<br />
No ladder taking you up to heaven,
unfortunately.<br />
If you ask when will you get fields of
mulberry?<br />
Time of Ox, Dragon, Snake or Horse will be
lucky.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Cuckoo on the branch is complaining about spring leaving.<br />
If you go towards the seaside, there&#8217;ll be
smooth luck in everything.<br />
A lot of people in high places will be
responding.<br />
Phoenix will be on the maple branch, stably
staying.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
On the other side of the world, a beautiful woman.<br />
Transplant peach and apricot, bring faraway
fragrance.<br />
Water fowls are happy together in the pond,
it seems.<br />
Chrysanthemum garden covered by thick
frost, like a dream.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Fairy peach on the branch, cinnamon flowers fragrant.<br />
Half the fruits are hurt and half of them
ripen.<br />
Family wearing red and purple, well worth a
smile,<br />
In your late years, smile is so worthwhile.<br />
Offspring will be holding many high
positions.</p>

<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Re-polishing Your Precious Sword<br />
</strong>The sword is very sharp.<br />
It is pure gold covered up by dust and
soil, it doesn&#8217;t give out brilliance.<br />
Prepare the stone to polish sword again in battlefield
of the Tiger and Dragon.<br />
Brightness from sword shines up to the
Small Dipper star and Cowboy star in the sky.<br />
Flock of wild geese split and reform.<br />
Inside the garden, the flowers blossom
again.<br />
Once the mountain meets the giant eye,<br />
You hear the horse neighing amidst ten
thousand flowers.<br />
Once ability is appreciated, you are placed
on horseback to go into the deep forest to have achievement.</p>
