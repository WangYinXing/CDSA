<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>In this life you were born with a character
that is very upright but a nature that is soft and tender.&nbsp; You have the heart to love people and never
intend to hurt anyone. Noble people will put you in an important position in
their eyes, so there is no need to be concerned about ignoble people, who will look
down on you. As you live with people with different surname, it could be that
you were adopted or placed in foster care. This is a positive situation as your
destiny is such that it would have been disadvantageous for you to stay in the
family.&nbsp; People can change. When you are
doing things, you can blow hot and cold. Sometimes you are very enthusiastic,
sometimes you are indifferent. You need to manage your expectations when you
are doing good things, for you cannot always expect a good return. Throughout
this life, you won&#8217;t be hit by poverty and there are no legal problems.&nbsp; However, luck is not with you in your early
days. Just as the melon is sweet, and the stalk is bitter, sweetness and
bitterness come in different parts of life. Nevertheless, you can live a long
life, which is very glorious in later years.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Gold and jade are not the real
treasures.<br />
Cannot
distinguish ling zhi<sup>1</sup>and orchids, from fragrant
grass.<br />
Beneath
the bright moon, cool breeze over lakes and rivers,&nbsp;<br />
To find
fame and long life, you borrow the path.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Start business with gold and jade, the original plan.<br />
Like rams knock down the fence, a defiant
enterprise,<br />
Becomes an empire with a long-lasting life
span.<br />
During sunset pick up profits to live a
leisurely life.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
You meet bright moon over autumn river.<br />
Halfway you see the flower wither,<br />
And just pick one branch.<br />
At night water fowls sleep in the water.<br />
Fragrant apple, water chestnut follow one
another.<br />
Marry again, second chance.</p>
<p>Children: ;<br />
Strange
flowers, strange fruits imply stepchildren.<br />
Due to
many hidden virtues, you enjoy filial duty.<br />
High
achievers bring glory to the family.<br />
Wearing
red and purple, they&#8217;re nobility.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
On the path that&#8217;s homeward bound,<br />
Walk without any companions.<br />
Under the moon, there in a lone boat, on the
cold river,<br />
Recollect your old home.<br />
See white clouds over the mountain, like a
beautiful picture.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Orchid, Ling Zhi (Medicinal Mushroom) and Fragrant Grass<br />
</strong>Gold and jade are not necessarily treasure.<br />
Your attention is focused on orchid,
medicinal mushrooms and fragrant grass.<br />
Your home is by the water and the clouds.<br />
How many flowers can you see on the top of
the trees?<br />
Pi-Pa<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;has broken string, mend the string to re-marry.<br />
In the evening, you enjoy the cool breeze.<br />
You seek another romance from the plum
blossom and snowy moon.<br />
Fortunately, there is not much fog on the waves,
and it is good to follow the emperor to visit places outside the capital.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Footnote 1<br />
Ling Zhi is a type of
medicinal mushroom believed to have anti-cancerous properties.</p>
<p>Footnote 2<br />
Pi-Pa is a string
musical instrument. Playing a Pi-Pa is symbolic of a happy marriage.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    It is beneficial for you to live and mix with people other than your own family, so be relaxed when you are away from the family home. Accept that there are ups and downs in life.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    Money is not everything (“gold and jade are not the real treasures”). Fragrant grass is quite common whereas Ling zhi (medicinal mushroom) and orchids are not. You need to distinguish between what is special from what is ordinary. When you have good luck (“bright moon, cool breeze”) you can find a way (“borrow the path”) to become well known.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    You invest in a new business (“start business with gold and jade”), but in the beginning it does not go according to plan (“Like rams knock down the fence, a defiant enterprise”). In the end, it turns out to be a lasting business and generates good profits for you in your later years (“during sunset”).
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    There is good fortune when it comes to relationships (“bright moon”) but it does not last (“flower wither”). However, you get another chance to marry again.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Your stepchildren are successful and influential (“wearing red and purple”). Because of good karma from your charitable acts your stepchildren are devoted to you. For followers, you can attract loyal and outstanding followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can look back and recall many highlights from your journey through life.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    Rather than focus on wealth, it would be a good idea to focus on your wellbeing. “Your home is by the water and the clouds” could be taken to mean you live near water, somewhere high up, or it could mean that you make your home anywhere you choose. You are likely to marry again later in life (“plum blossom and snowy moon” imply your winter years, the last stage of your life). Fortunately, not much blocks your path through life and it is good to follow the leader (“emperor”) to step out into the wider world.
