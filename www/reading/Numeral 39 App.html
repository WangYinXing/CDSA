<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>In life you are full of good planning, you
are very careful, and can look into the depth of everything. &nbsp;Your character is very blunt and straight.
Since you are quite serious in your work, you often put yourself under
pressure.&nbsp; Added to that, you get little
help from relatives. To begin with, a spouse and children turn out to be empty
dreams. Just as a branch can have buds that blossom again, another marriage brings
three daughters and you can generate an ordinary income to raise your family. Since
working in your hometown is disadvantageous, it is suitable for you to make a
change and not to follow the family profession. The hidden sickness in your
body is difficult to cure. Even though the foundation of your life is stable,
luck is not with you. Be content, wait for right time to come, then your hidden
ability will be useful. Eventually, you will have good luck one day.&nbsp; If good things come, what does it matter if
they come late?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
In the barn enough old grain handed
down.<br />
Best to
make a new living, leave hometown.<br />
Success
depends on the help from outside<br />
You&#8217;ll
get real reward, heaven will provide.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
In Rat or Ox year, it&#8217;s time to advance.<br />
Years of Horse and Ox fly to the nine skies.<br />
When determined, dangers bring no worries.<br />
If you&#8217;re kind-hearted, won&#8217;t have many
enemies.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Mandarin ducks disturbed by shocking events from nowhere.<br />
When happy, what can break a relationship?
Beware!<br />
In the end you are accompanied by many
children<br />
To the pine and bamboo forest, to enjoy
retirement.</p>
<p>Children: <br />
Children
are vulnerable to wind and rain.<br />
After
the rainfall, no fruit on pine tree.<br />
To bring
fortune, do deeds for charity,<br />
In old
age your kids keep you company.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Dog or Goat year prepare to go,<br />
To cross fairy bridge no need a crane to
ride.<br />
Pine and bamboo thrive by the waterside.<br />
Monkey and crane calling over nine skies.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Rat in Old Barn<br />
</strong>Rice in the old barn is more than enough
for you to eat.<br />
If half is eaten by rats, there is still
plenty for you.<br />
You are destined to be lonely therefore you
should leave your hometown.<br />
Being very clever, you do not need to
study.<br />
There are a lot of things on your mind
bothering you.<br />
You are not satisfied with your achievements.<br />
In front of your garden two trees are
blossoming, then you roll up the curtain to enjoy the beautiful scenery.</p>
