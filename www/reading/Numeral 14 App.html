<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This is a life ruled by a star with a good
reputation that exceeds its talents. The stars are not that bright. When you
are alone you feel comfortable.&nbsp; There is
no easy fortune in this life, you have to work for it. You cannot rely on your ancestors.
Relatives are cold towards you. Few people can understand you but you can
understand others.&nbsp; Fortunately, the
Heavenly Abundance Star is in power. Whatever appears risky is not dangerous.
Whatever appears disastrous is not really so bad. You think about things a lot
but do very little.&nbsp; In your spare time,
you are often found in contemplation.&nbsp; When
you have more money, you have less enjoyment.&nbsp;&nbsp;
It is good to develop stillness and quiet at home, for then you can live
a long life.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Not
really much closeness with your good family.<br />
When you
go out in the world to make money,<br />
There
will be help, not from relatives, but from old friends.<br />
Fame and
fortune will come to you in the end.</p>
<p>Life Path:&nbsp;<br />
Tiger year is a good time for starting
something new.<br />
Remember
to invite old friends to come visit you.&nbsp;<br />
You are
like big bird Peng that flies far.<br />
Great
ambition brings the best reward.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
It is all pre-destined, marriage can
be short or long.<br />
Under
the new moon, when the flowers are all gone,<br />
You are
listening to crows.<br />
In later
years, when you are old,<br />
You are
not without a companion.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
The fruits in your garden are not good.<br />
Like a peach on a willow
tree grown,<br />
Adopt a child and
treat as your own.<br />
When you are old,
grow bamboo,<br />
Your students will
be close to you.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Flowers are withering, nightingale is
old,<br />
Riding a
crane through blue skies foretold.<br />
Whatever
happened before is like a dream.<br />
Stroll along the garden path, gently roam.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Fish Swimming in Clear Lake<br />
</strong>Not much connection or contact with
relatives.<br />
Leaving your hometown, you have your own
family elsewhere.<br />
Success and failure all pre-destined.<br />
Fame and fortune is unpredictable.<br />
Wind disturbs the bees by the water.<br />
When the water gets cold, mandarin ducks
swim in own directions to catch fish.<br />
Whether the flowers can produce fruits? Ask
heaven.<br />
It is difficult to get hold of your foundations.<br />
Whether your friends are your true friends,
you will have to test.<br />
If you come across a friend share the green
pine cones, and treat good friends well.</p>
