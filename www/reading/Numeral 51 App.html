<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>In this life, you are often going the wrong
direction because instead of walking in the dark shining a light on the path
ahead, it is like you are walking backwards and shining a light on where you
have just stepped. Reflecting on where you have just been is not the same as
looking at where you are going. You are carefree and although you are good at
starting things, finishing them is another matter.&nbsp; Your character is one with low tolerance
levels and you are uncompromising. Therefore, it is not easy for you to enjoy a
harmonious marriage and it is suitable to have children late in life.&nbsp; You need rely on your own pair of hands and not
to count on relatives being able to give you support. Opportunities to meet honorable
people come before you, but it is not easy to seriously prosper. Be wary of
playing host to those friends who give sarcastic remarks after enjoying your
generous hospitality.&nbsp; It can feel like
you do not receive the full rewards for all your good deeds, yet you want to do
them. Whoever you saved might not show their gratitude. You have to be careful
with everything, sadly, this is your fate.</p>

company when you are old.<br />
When travelling
and meeting the water flowing in peach valley what is seen is the ox sleeping
under the willow tree.</p>

<p>Footnote 1<br />
A couple making music
together is a metaphor for a marriage. A broken string on a musical instrument
means that one of the couple has died and to mend the string means to
re-marry.&nbsp; In ancient China the mortality
rate was high and it was fairly common to lose a spouse.</p>
<p>Footnote 2<br />
Pipa is a string
musical instrument. To put down a musical instrument and sing without it
implies one half of the couple has departed.</p>
