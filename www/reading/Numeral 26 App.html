<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is half full and half empty.
Sometimes it is clear, sometimes it is muddy. &nbsp;When you are supposed to be popular, you are
not really popular. When you are supposed to be lonely, you are not lonely. You
are not a monk and you are not a Daoist priest. Somehow there is not quite
enough to go round, it is like a frantic juggling act to keep all the balls in
the air, or like moving nine lids around to cover ten pots. When it comes to expressing
your ideas, what you lack in being articulate, you compensate for by loving
being flamboyant. You bury your ambition and you betray your intelligence.
Since you cannot make up your mind, you experience both success and failure. It
is suitable for you to leave your hometown and live in another place.&nbsp; If you were born in the south, then in your
later years you will be living in the north. If there is no danger and no
obstruction, even the hidden diseases cannot be perilous. Your future meets
with wind and frost quite early in your life. It is during those days that you
build up the foundation for your success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Leave your hometown, north and south
you travel,<br />
Build up
career, from east to west you bustle.<br />
Far from
home, get to know places powerful.<br />
Alas,
fame and fortune are only occasional.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Peach trees in your garden are not yet
blossoming,<br />
One
branch of the plum tree blossoms in the east wind.<br />
Even
though snow and frost have long been governing,<br />
In the
end, your house receives warm sun coming in.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Like the flowers of water plants that float
around,<br />
Unattached,
you remain single for many a season.<br />
Enjoying
good times when you have a companion.<br />
Cuckoo
crying over azalea, you might end up forlorn.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
A flower blooms, you have a daughter,<br />
By the
west wind carried, she goes to get married.<br />
Bamboo
grows well, many grandchildren thereafter,<br />
Not like
dragons, more like worms, not really go-getters.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
There is a rabbit, you see the side of it.<br />
Shoot an arrow, good tidings are expected.<br />
You are invincible, you got what you
wanted.<br />
Hunting dogs bark at bushes, rabbit has
sprinted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Lone Wild Goose Deserted by the Flock<br />
</strong>You watch the steps from afar.<br />
When you really climb the ladder it is very
exhausting.<br />
You spend three springs in the snow, to
realize the different faces of people.<br />
Like a crowd watching a chess match, they
cheer you on when you win, they criticize you when you lose.&nbsp; You are treated differently according to your
achievement.<br />
The wild goose flying south loses its
companion.<br />
Outside the forest you pick up a bud in
spring.<br />
If you still work hard for a better future,
you will have more than enough for your needs then you can fill your golden cup
with good wine.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can experience both hopeful (“half full”) times and pessimistic (“half empty”) times. “If there is no danger and no obstruction, even the hidden diseases cannot be perilous” suggests that when there are no signs of misfortune, there will not be unseen problems. “Your future meets with wind and frost quite early in your life” implies that you learn to handle difficulties when you are young. 
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can leave your hometown and travel around to advance your career. You can spend a lot of time in top places with influential people, yet success is sporadic. 
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    In the beginning, you need to work hard. There are opportunities (“one branch of the plum tree blossoms in the east wind”) and you can handle difficulties (“snow and frost”). You will be rewarded in the end.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    To begin with you enjoy the single life then you enjoy being in a couple. In the end, you might choose to be on your own (“cuckoo crying over azalea, you might end up forlorn”).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can have a daughter who gives you many grandchildren. The grandchildren will tend to be not very ambitious. For followers, you can have loyal followers, yet they might not be very enterprising.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You spot an opportunity (“rabbit”) and go after it. Avoid being complacent because maybe you've not really got hold of it, even though you think you have.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “You watch the steps from afar” suggests that you have high ambitions. It is hard work when you are aiming for the top of your field. It takes you three years to understand that people can be insincere (“three springs in the snow, to realize the different faces of people”). When you lose a relationship, you find another one (“Wild goose flying south loses its companion. Outside the forest you pick up a bud in spring”).
