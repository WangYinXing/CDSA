<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This life is half full and half empty.
Sometimes it is clear, sometimes it is muddy. &nbsp;When you are supposed to be popular, you are
not really popular. When you are supposed to be lonely, you are not lonely. You
are not a monk and you are not a Daoist priest. Somehow there is not quite
enough to go round, it is like a frantic juggling act to keep all the balls in
the air, or like moving nine lids around to cover ten pots. When it comes to expressing
your ideas, what you lack in being articulate, you compensate for by loving
being flamboyant. You bury your ambition and you betray your intelligence.
Since you cannot make up your mind, you experience both success and failure. It
is suitable for you to leave your hometown and live in another place.&nbsp; If you were born in the south, then in your
later years you will be living in the north. If there is no danger and no
obstruction, even the hidden diseases cannot be perilous. Your future meets
with wind and frost quite early in your life. It is during those days that you
build up the foundation for your success.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Leave your hometown, north and south
you travel,<br />
Build up
career, from east to west you bustle.<br />
Far from
home, get to know places powerful.<br />
Alas,
fame and fortune are only occasional.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Peach trees in your garden are not yet
blossoming,<br />
One
branch of the plum tree blossoms in the east wind.<br />
Even
though snow and frost have long been governing,<br />
In the
end, your house receives warm sun coming in.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Like the flowers of water plants that float
around,<br />
Unattached,
you remain single for many a season.<br />
Enjoying
good times when you have a companion.<br />
Cuckoo
crying over azalea, you might end up forlorn.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
A flower blooms, you have a daughter,<br />
By the
west wind carried, she goes to get married.<br />
Bamboo
grows well, many grandchildren thereafter,<br />
Not like
dragons, more like worms, not really go-getters.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
There is a rabbit, you see the side of it.<br />
Shoot an arrow, good tidings are expected.<br />
You are invincible, you got what you
wanted.<br />
Hunting dogs bark at bushes, rabbit has
sprinted.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Lone Wild Goose Deserted by the Flock<br />
</strong>You watch the steps from afar.<br />
When you really climb the ladder it is very
exhausting.<br />
You spend three springs in the snow, to
realize the different faces of people.<br />
Like a crowd watching a chess match, they
cheer you on when you win, they criticize you when you lose.&nbsp; You are treated differently according to your
achievement.<br />
The wild goose flying south loses its
companion.<br />
Outside the forest you pick up a bud in
spring.<br />
If you still work hard for a better future,
you will have more than enough for your needs then you can fill your golden cup
with good wine.</p>
