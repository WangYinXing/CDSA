<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This life is that of a lazy star and a gloomy
star.&nbsp; Whatever you may do, you regret
your actions.&nbsp; Whether walking or sitting
down you cannot make up your mind. You do not like to owe anyone a favor.&nbsp; You do not know how to embellish your actions
with charm. Whilst there is no need to worry about making a living, you need to
change. If you hold onto your inheritance, you will lose support from relatives
and friends. If you sit down for too long you will have illness of your four
limbs. Leave your hometown to make a fortune<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp;What should be done quickly you take it slowly. When you should be taking your
time, you act hastily.&nbsp; Your character is
quite contrary in what should be quick and slow. There is no clear success or
failure. Whenever you face danger or obstacles, there will always be someone
coming to the rescue.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
When there are happy times, enjoy, feel
pleased.<br />
Why lower your ambitions? There is no need.<br />
During Tiger years move forward, get ahead.<br />
Like the powerful tiger prowling in the
forest.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Leave your hometown and you will
succeed.<br />
Live a
strict and honest life, you will feel much peace.<br />
Like a
general enjoying victory, on the border of the territory.<br />
When
your spirits are low, make changes and grow.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
No need to worry about marital harmony.<br />
When
your boat first sets sail, strong winds may blow.<br />
How will
the relationship be? You want to know.<br />
Imagine
at twilight a pair of ducks swimming together.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
With fewer sons and more daughters.<br />
They will marry into
wealthy families.<br />
Enjoying being
rich and famous,<br />
They live a fortunate
life, most leisurely.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Flowers bloom into full beauty, vying
for attention.<br />
After
wind and rain goes on day and night,<br />
Flowers
are all gone, not a pretty sight.<br />
In Ding and
Ren years forget big dreams, lose ambition.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Fisherman Bringing in the Nets<br />
</strong>When the catch is brought in, the boat is
light.<br />
The soldiers raise the standard to march
out of the castle.<br />
The general on the border misses the home
country.<br />
On the road away from home, both lows and
highs,<br />
Make good plans to leave whilst you are a
youth.<br />
Soar upwards like a goose through open
skies.<br />
When the flowers are gone and the moon is
full,You&#8217;ll have many good memories, that&#8217;ll be the
truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Footnote 1&nbsp;<br />
The original text
talks about how a son would be handed over for adoption by a paternal uncle or
a man would marry into a family and his children would take the mother&#8217;s
surname.&nbsp; If a wealthy family only had
daughters, then in order to continue the family line, one of the son-in-laws
would allow his children to take his wife&#8217;s surname. In both cases the man
would be leaving his hometown, therefore, in a modern context, it has been
translated as &#8216;leave your hometown&#8217;</p>
