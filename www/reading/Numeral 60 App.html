<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This is a life that is full of great
knowledge and great ideas, combined with superb planning skills. You are very
controversial. Failure and success are undetermined.&nbsp;You know how to be non-committal and how to
handle situations. Fame and fortune are not easily attainable. Because you can
chop down big trees, you can handle major matters, but because you can burn a
frying pan, you are not so adept with minor matters. If you get something with
great skill, and lose the same in a clumsy way, then you know it is destiny that
overrides your effort. In Ox and Goat years you can enjoy fortune.</p>

</strong>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Cannot meet the one in red, a benefactor.<br />
Although the lotus rhizome grows in mud,<br />
What emerges is a beautiful flower.<br />
At the
water concourse, noticed by someone helpful,<br />
With
such assistance, you can be successful.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Dig apart the stones to bring water from the stream to reach the sea.<br />
In autumn, flowers blossom on the cinnamon
tree.<br />
When it&#8217;s time for your good luck you&#8217;ll
have celebrity.<br />
Because of good deeds, you&#8217;ll establish a
good family.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
From a grain of sand in the clam a pearl forms,<br />
Into a dragon, with pearl in mouth, it
transforms.<br />
Who knows, dragon will be trapped in dry
pond, unfortunately.<br />
For the right time to enjoy romance and
marriage, wait patiently.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Three branches with one fruit to bear.<br />
Rat and Horse year born are superior.<br />
The qi lin, a gift, heaven confers,<br />
A wonderful son, with a great career,<br />
Makes family famous and revered.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
When should it be that you establish your life?<br />
When you meet the Horse or the Ox, the time
is right.<br />
When you see youngsters dancing and singing
in the water,<br />
It&#8217;s time to enjoy the good music on
horseback, thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Flowers Withering in Late Autumn<br />
</strong>When you have made a lot of money, in late
autumn there will be losses.<br />
When you expect success, there is danger.<br />
Those flowers that can stand the cold are
blossoming in late autumn.<br />
Mandarin ducks who do not like the cold
will fly away at midnight.<br />
Patience is the right way to steer a middle
course.<br />
It is not right to make rapid decisions without
good planning.<br />
You have to imagine that your home is far
away, many mountains away.<br />
You have early success and everything has a
pre-determined timetable.</p>
