<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>
This is a life that is full of great
knowledge and great ideas, combined with superb planning skills. You are very
controversial. Failure and success are undetermined.&nbsp;You know how to be non-committal and how to
handle situations. Fame and fortune are not easily attainable. Because you can
chop down big trees, you can handle major matters, but because you can burn a
frying pan, you are not so adept with minor matters. If you get something with
great skill, and lose the same in a clumsy way, then you know it is destiny that
overrides your effort. In Ox and Goat years you can enjoy fortune.</p>
<strong><br clear="all" />
</strong>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Cannot meet the one in red, a benefactor.<br />
Although the lotus rhizome grows in mud,<br />
What emerges is a beautiful flower.<br />
At the
water concourse, noticed by someone helpful,<br />
With
such assistance, you can be successful.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Dig apart the stones to bring water from the stream to reach the sea.<br />
In autumn, flowers blossom on the cinnamon
tree.<br />
When it&#8217;s time for your good luck you&#8217;ll
have celebrity.<br />
Because of good deeds, you&#8217;ll establish a
good family.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
From a grain of sand in the clam a pearl forms,<br />
Into a dragon, with pearl in mouth, it
transforms.<br />
Who knows, dragon will be trapped in dry
pond, unfortunately.<br />
For the right time to enjoy romance and
marriage, wait patiently.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Three branches with one fruit to bear.<br />
Rat and Horse year born are superior.<br />
The qi lin, a gift, heaven confers,<br />
A wonderful son, with a great career,<br />
Makes family famous and revered.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
When should it be that you establish your life?<br />
When you meet the Horse or the Ox, the time
is right.<br />
When you see youngsters dancing and singing
in the water,<br />
It&#8217;s time to enjoy the good music on
horseback, thereafter.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Flowers Withering in Late Autumn<br />
</strong>When you have made a lot of money, in late
autumn there will be losses.<br />
When you expect success, there is danger.<br />
Those flowers that can stand the cold are
blossoming in late autumn.<br />
Mandarin ducks who do not like the cold
will fly away at midnight.<br />
Patience is the right way to steer a middle
course.<br />
It is not right to make rapid decisions without
good planning.<br />
You have to imagine that your home is far
away, many mountains away.<br />
You have early success and everything has a
pre-determined timetable.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Even though you have the ability to succeed, there are times when luck goes against you. You can expect good times in Ox years and Goat years.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Cannot meet the one in red, a benefactor” means it is not easy for you to get the backing of an influential person. Even though you find yourself in a challenging situation (“lotus rhizome grows in mud”) you will eventually flourish (beautiful flower emerges). When you are at a crossroads, you might meet someone who helps you find success.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    You work hard (“dig apart the stones”) to have achievement (“bring water from the stream to reach the sea”). Success will come to you later in life (“flowers blossom on cinnamon tree”). You will gain a good reputation.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    It takes time for a beautiful relationship to develop (pearl forming from a grain of sand), yet there could be changes, which turn out unfavourably (dragon trapped in dry pond). Be easy-going when it comes to finding a good match for it takes time and persistence.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Three branches with one fruit to bear” suggests that you have a few children with one being a good son. “The qi lin, a gift, heaven confers” suggests that your son will be extraordinary. The qi lin is a Chinese unicorn and it is said to appear when an outstanding person is about to be born. For followers, you will have an amazing follower who can make your legacy famous.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    A Horse year, or an Ox year, is good timing for establishing yourself. You notice others enjoying themselves (dancing and singing). You too will enjoy yourself in a Horse year (on horseback).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “When you have made a lot of money, in late autumn there will be losses” implies that you need to be prepared to protect your assets in later life. Ventures that can get through hard times could prosper later (blossoming in late autumn). Some relationships cannot survive difficulties (mandarin ducks fly away). “You have to imagine that your home is far away, over many mountains away,” suggests that you have a plan for the future.
