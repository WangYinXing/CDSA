<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is full of good planning and
technical skills. When you spend money, you can get good returns. Whatever you
need to do, you do it in the proper way.&nbsp;Unfortunately, your destiny is meeting the
Retreating Spirit, you do not always move forwards. You are very calculating,
and you calculate very accurately and have necessary capital to do whatever you
want. Even though you may work hard, up to midnight, you can muddle up what you
have done. If you want success, you have to make a lot of reforms. It is just
because your destiny chart is firm. Even though there is danger, what turns up will
only be half of what was expected. The malevolent forces will somehow be mitigated.
In your old age you are strong, you are just as energetic as when you were
young. When you reach water to help you, you will have great achievement. Water
years will be the most successful times for you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
The pine trees grow on ground so high,
reaching up towards the sky,<br />
Like the
pine sinking roots amongst the rocks, your base is secure.<br />
Young
and ambitious, your goal to establish a large empire,<br />
As the
years wear away, you draw your sword and play,<br />
Lament on
all the problems that brought you dismay.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
The capital city, a thousand miles away,<br />
Eventually, you reach the destination.<br />
Rise through the ranks, gaining a position.<br />
Return home before the end of the story,<br />
Enjoy bamboo, pine and mulberry.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
On meeting your beloved during your
prime,<br />
You
cannot expect it to last for all time.<br />
Together
when the moon, bright and beautiful,<br />
Pond
full of sea birds, enjoy being a couple.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Fruits as sons, two or three,<br />
Leave one in the forest.<br />
Good sons bring glory to your family,<br />
Because in a past life, many good deeds.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In years of Dog or Ox, with water,<br />
Dive to
the sea bed, collect coral.<br />
Ox or Goat
year, doing well, cross the bridge to the fairies,<br />
Enjoy
being by west lake with beautiful willow trees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Crane Standing on the Pine Tree<br />
</strong>Pine tree stands proudly in spring and
autumn.<br />
White crane tries to land on top of the tree,
even if some branches are broken in heavy frost and snow.<br />
The pine is quite a different structure
from the flowering peach and plum trees.~<br />
Your relatives leave you like a floating
cloud.<br />
Whatever assets you have will be halved,
yet half will be enough.<br />
If you take good care of the mulberry tree
in your back garden, you will enjoy the shade of the tree in the end.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are organised and like to do things properly. Your destiny is such you do not always move forwards, you may need to take a step back before you can advance (“meeting the Retreating spirit, you do not always move forwards”). Water years can mean those years beginning with a digit 2 or a digit 3, e.g. 1992, 1993, 2002, 2003, 2012, 2013, 2022, 2023, etc. Water years can also mean Pig years (1995, 2007, 2019, etc) or Rat years (1996, 2008, 2020, etc).
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You have high ambitions and a solid foundation. Later on in life, you can look back on what worked out and what did not.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The capital city” can mean the headquarters or any large organisation. You have career success and enjoy your retirement.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    Married life can be satisfying. It is important to make the most of the good times you share together.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can have two or three sons. Your sons will be successful because of your good karma from a past life. For followers, your followers will have achievement.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    In Dog years or Ox years you can gain wealth (“dive to the sea bed to collect coral”). Coral was seen as something precious. Ox and Goat years can also prove to be fortunate and you could find yourself in beautiful surroundings.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are full of determination (“Pine tree stands proudly in spring and autumn”), and can remain persistent in the face of adversity (“even if some branches are broken in heavy frost and snow”). You can endure challenges that others might not face. You cannot rely on your relatives. If you look after what you have, you will have enough for what you need.
