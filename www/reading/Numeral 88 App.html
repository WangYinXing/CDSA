<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is like the autumn moon at
night.&nbsp; It is as cold as the frosty sky
in the morning. There are not enough friends. You work doubly as hard. When you
are enthusiastic you will encounter gossip. When there should be nothing, there
is a storm. When there should be a good ending, there is something missing. When
people should enjoy beauty there are regrets. Every day you have to run around.
Everywhere you are looking for trouble.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Lonely pine tree and dying cedar know it is windy and rainy.<br />
Change leaves and re-locate roots, then there&#8217;s
prosperity.<br />
When time goes like the flowing waters
carrying the petals, spring is quiet.<br />
Go over two layers of mountain before earning
a good name to your credit.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
The road is long, but to the waterfront, it doesn&#8217;t bring you.<br />
To become successful get rid of the old and
follow the new.<br />
No matter how many rivers and mountains you
go through,<br />
Eventually must go home, in old age enjoy
glory you pursued.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Pair of mandarin ducks are standing in
pond, stand in two.<br />
Under
the bright moon lament over your solitude,<br />
Apple
blossoms and water plants quiet and subdued,<br />
Fisherman
spends time by clear water when fishing concludes.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Two flowers with petals fallen.<br />
A branch with fruit in autumn.<br />
Don&#8217;t sigh over green and yellow colors.<br />
Maybe worries among the mulberry trees.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Luck is gone with Rooster and Dog, years that were lucky.<br />
In old age there are some things to cause
you to worry.<br />
Upon the broken, ceramic roof tiles, the
ice is melting.<br />
On wide and endless sea, on a boat as a
guest, you&#8217;re sailing.</p>

<p><strong>Style:
Flying Geese Parading Over the Sky<br />
</strong>When the sky is high and the land is wide,<br />
It is quite difficult to depend on your
wings.<br />
Two cranes flying high do not return in
time.<br />
When the water is flowing in the opposite
direction to the clouds,<br />
Flowers are carried away by the waves.<br />
When time is not with you, all your efforts
will be in vain.<br />
When luck is with you, you do not need to
sweat.<br />
If you put out everything and just go along
with people,<br />
Then, rice in jade bowl and soup in golden
dish will bring good tidings.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    The “autumn moon at night” is most bright, which suggests you have good luck. However, there could be a lack of emotional support (“as cold as the frosty sky in the morning”). Managing your expectations is the key to making the most of life. 
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Lonely pine tree and dying cedar know it is windy and rainy,” implies that you remain determined through difficult times. To prosper you need to make some major changes (“change leaves and re-locate roots”). Be patient when you are young (“spring is quiet”), because success will come after overcoming many challenges (“go over two layers of mountain”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    Success is a long journey, which involves discarding old ideas and implementing new concepts. It is predicted that you will return to your hometown in your later years to enjoy the rewards from your efforts.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    A pleasant and tranquil married life is predicted (“apple blossoms and water plants quiet and subdued, fisherman spends time by clear water when fishing concludes”), yet you also spend time in your own company (“lament over your solitude”).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    It is predicted that children will come later in life (“fruit in autumn”). There is no need to worry over what might have been because you have good luck (“mulberry trees”). For followers, good ones will join you later.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You enjoy good luck during Rooster and Dog years. “Upon the broken, ceramic roof tiles, the ice is melting,” suggests that in your later years, there are matters at home that require your attention. Nevertheless, you can still enjoy yourself (“On wide and endless sea, on a boat as a guest, you’re sailing”).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You want to go far and you have a long way to go (“sky is high and the land is wide, it is quite difficult to depend on your wings”). It might not all go according to plan (“Two cranes flying high do not return in time”). If you go with the flow, you can expect things to work out, eventually.
