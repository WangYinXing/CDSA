<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>You are a born leader with planning and
management capabilities.&nbsp; A highly
ethical law abiding citizen, people look up to you as a role model. Being
discerning means you can easily distinguish the good from the bad, and you know
what is what. Like a pillar of a house you like to be useful and supportive. Unfortunately,
the Heavenly Failure star is in the central palace, this makes the Retreating
Spirit too heavy.&nbsp; It is tempting to
retreat when life is not going your way, instead believe in yourself and remain
steadfast to your goals. Misfortune will not be entirely harmful, but good
things can be easily dispersed as well.&nbsp;
Competing during the lion dance, you make an attempt to collect the
hanging reward from the hundred foot bamboo pole. You are not afraid to go for
the top when it comes to competitions. You are brave enough to sail on stormy
seas and can stay calm in the face of crisis. Why doesn&#8217;t danger bother you?
Because of the Heavenly Mechanical star coming to your rescue whenever you need
it.&nbsp; You enjoy being helpful and can have
a tendency to take on too much, then you wonder why there aren&#8217;t enough people
to give you a hand! As well as making your mark as a worthy pillar of the
community, remember to pay attention to your family.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Before you are rich, protect your name
to look after your family.<br />
The
preparation to be prime minister is known already.<br />
Waterways
need to be cleared, before you can steer a boat,<br />
To feast
your eyes upon resplendent mulberry trees.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Rabbit, Rooster, Dragon and Tiger years you have success.<br />
Make good use of a situation on the road to
give orders.<br />
In both Ox and Horse years, profits are the
best.<br />
Who gets the status to conquer the
barbarians in the west?</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
At phoenix penthouse and dragon terrace spend time together,<br />
To enjoy beautiful bright moon, the cool
breeze is wonderful weather.<br />
Mandarin ducks part, to the east, to the
west, away each one flies.<br />
Good days over, flowers won&#8217;t be glowing
again before your eyes.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
East wind blows over the peach on the golden branch.<br />
Every flower, branch and leaf hangs firmly
on the tree.<br />
Come close to the beautiful and fragrant
orchids again.<br />
Descendants carrying on good family
business, you&#8217;re happy!</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
You serve three emperors, as a duke in three reigns.<br />
When in Rabbit and Ox years you experience
change.<br />
When you wait for the autumn moon in your
jade parlor<br />
You sleep in the west wind enjoying peace
of mind.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Sieving gold from sand<br />
</strong>Don&#8217;t blame being busy throughout your life.<br />
Filtering gold from sand doesn&#8217;t require
much skill.<br />
When the wild goose is flying over the
village, it leaves only a shadow.<br />
Mandarin ducks flying over the sand dunes
does not leave any footprints behind.<br />
You have gone over experiences half sweet
and half bitter.<br />
No matter how much you worry, it is going
to be emptiness.<br />
It happens that the fairy peach is
blossoming for quite a while, leaving behind one flower to keep the spring wind
company.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The Heavenly Failure star is in the central palace, this makes the Retreating Spirit too heavy” means that you need to persist in when you encounter setbacks. If you don’t succeed at first stay determined and pick yourself up when you are down. The lucky stars will shine brightly and rescue you when you need it the most (“Heavenly Mechanical star coming to your rescue”).
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    It is important to protect your reputation. A high-flying career (“to be prime minister”) requires some careful planning. Once the way ahead is clear you will find success (“feast your eyes upon resplendent mulberry trees”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    To “make good use of a situation on the road to give orders” means you have authority. You are brave when it comes to facing new challenges (“the status to conquer the barbarians in the west”).
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You visit dazzling places as a couple (“phoenix penthouse and dragon terrace spend time together”) and enjoy yourselves (“enjoy beautiful moon, the cool breeze”). Make the most of the good times you share.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    You have good children who are able to take over a successful family business. For followers, your followers will be able to continue your legacy.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You hold many positions of power, under three consecutive leaders (“serve three emperors”). There is a peaceful retirement waiting for you.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    Your life is meant to be busy and you need to keep going. A lot of what happens is fleeting and does not leave a lasting impression. Reflect on all the sweetness as well as the bitterness of experience.
