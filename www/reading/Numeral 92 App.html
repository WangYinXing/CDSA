<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>You are born with an intelligent character
and a tall and noble appearance. You know your station in life. You are able to
weigh up priorities and differentiate between what is pressing and what you can
let go off. Even when you give the impression of being unconcerned, you have
worries inside your heart. You are graceful and charitable towards others. Unfortunately,
there are ungrateful people around you.</p>

<p>Marriage:<br />
Mandarin ducks wrapped necks, it was like
yesterday.<br />
Turbulent ups and downs caused ducks to fly
away.<br />
Late in your life, flowers wither away and
are gone.<br />
New branches come out on old tree, can be
relied on.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Three flowers means daughters, two fruits means sons.<br />
Green and yellow beautify the branches, one
by one.<br />
In thick snow and heavy frost, damage can
be done.<br />
Unexposed good deeds give children
protection.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Horse and Goat bring difficult days in your
prime.<br />
When drunk, see withered flowers, dreams
not on time.<br />
Recollect your entire life, everything is
like a dream.<br />
In the end crane and monkey keep you
company in the mountain.</p>

Flying onto a high branch and staying there.<br />
Fly into the clouds to leave for south.<br />
Companion is playing in the pond.<br />
Everywhere the flowers are blossoming, but
yours are not.<br />
When they bloom great gusts come.<br />
All the flowers are gone in the morning,
new buds are coming,<br />
Spring scenery is found all over the nine
mountains.</p>
