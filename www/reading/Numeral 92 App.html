<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>You are born with an intelligent character
and a tall and noble appearance. You know your station in life. You are able to
weigh up priorities and differentiate between what is pressing and what you can
let go off. Even when you give the impression of being unconcerned, you have
worries inside your heart. You are graceful and charitable towards others. Unfortunately,
there are ungrateful people around you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Flowers blossom in gardens everywhere you go.<br />
&#8216;Why is my garden covered in frost and
snow?&#8217;<br />
They&#8217;re lucky, good days do not come to you
early.<br />
One day the sun&#8217;s warmth will return to
spring valley.<br />
Then you will be aroused and become young
again.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
All sorts of barriers you encounter.<br />
Lofty ambitions to gain power.<br />
At the right time no more you suffer.<br />
Wealth and recognition from endeavors.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Mandarin ducks wrapped necks, it was like
yesterday.<br />
Turbulent ups and downs caused ducks to fly
away.<br />
Late in your life, flowers wither away and
are gone.<br />
New branches come out on old tree, can be
relied on.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Three flowers means daughters, two fruits means sons.<br />
Green and yellow beautify the branches, one
by one.<br />
In thick snow and heavy frost, damage can
be done.<br />
Unexposed good deeds give children
protection.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Horse and Goat bring difficult days in your
prime.<br />
When drunk, see withered flowers, dreams
not on time.<br />
Recollect your entire life, everything is
like a dream.<br />
In the end crane and monkey keep you
company in the mountain.</p>

Big Bird Peng Fighting Against the Wind<br />
</strong>Big bird Peng leaves the northern territory.<br />
Flying onto a high branch and staying there.<br />
Fly into the clouds to leave for south.<br />
Companion is playing in the pond.<br />
Everywhere the flowers are blossoming, but
yours are not.<br />
When they bloom great gusts come.<br />
All the flowers are gone in the morning,
new buds are coming,<br />
Spring scenery is found all over the nine
mountains.</p>

<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Flowers blossom in gardens everywhere you go. Why is my garden covered in frost and snow?” suggests that when you are young, you notice others have more luck than you do. When you are older, luck is with you, and you still feel young at heart.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    You need to overcome obstacles before you can fulfil your ambitions. Fame and fortune come when luck is with you.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Mandarin ducks wrapped necks, it was like yesterday” suggests a happy romance. Your relationship goes through difficult times. “Flowers wither away” implies that romance fades, yet you still have a reliable spouse.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Three daughters and two sons are predicted. By creating good karma with charitable acts your children can overcome difficulties (“In thick snow and heavy frost”). For followers, you can attract many of them.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Horse and Goat bring difficult days in your prime,” can refer to Horse years and Goat years being less fortunate, or it can mean you need to overcome difficulties in your prime years. Be patient, for it takes time to achieve your goals (“When drunk, see withered flowers, dreams not on time”). You enjoy a quiet life when you retire.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    Big bird Peng is a legendary bird that can fly long distances. When Peng will “fly into the clouds to leave for south,” it suggests you need to be prepared for a lengthy journey to success. Things might not work out for you in the beginning (“everywhere the flowers are blossoming, but yours are not”). After early disappointment, it works out well in the end (“new buds are coming, spring scenery is found all over the nine mountains”).
