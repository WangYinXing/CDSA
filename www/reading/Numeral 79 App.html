<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>The star of Three Penalties and the star of
Seven Malicious Spirits shine on this life. To avoid misfortune it is very
important to cultivate kindness in your heart, and to show this kindness to all
living creatures. You are particularly suited to being a vegetarian and it
would have the added benefit of making your appearance more attractive. Easy to
get angry and easy to get happy is the essential nature of your character. It
is suitable for you to leave your hometown and establish a new life.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
For the flowers on the mountain, it is
finally raining,<br />
Even
though there&#8217;s spring light they aren&#8217;t talking.<br />
When flowers
open up, it is like they&#8217;re moving mouths chatting.<br />
One day
when the warm air comes back, when warm air returning.<br />
Nightingales
and flowers, the orchard and forest will be attracting.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Ride the Ox and Horse at times when it&#8217;s lucky<br />
Middle age is better than years that came
early.<br />
Success and fortune due to own efforts
purely,<br />
Do the right things and everything will be
easy.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
When it&#8217;s a cloudless sky, from heaven there&#8217;s a beautiful light.<br />
Coming out again from the clouds is the
moon so bright.<br />
Mandarin ducks fly away then return to
re-unite.<br />
In the pond, there are water fowls standing
upright.</p>
<p>Children: <br />
In late spring, one fruit left after all
the blossom.<br />
One branch bears ripe and unripe fruits in
autumn.<br />
Eventually, there will be a peach that
ripens.<br />
This one will be with the golden mother to
toast her birthday celebrations.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Horse and Ox bring a lot of difficulties.<br />
With the Dog will be crossing mountains in
safety.<br />
Like flowing water and the fallen petals in
quiet late spring,<br />
Seagulls and white pelicans pass time quietly.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Moon and Venus Compete in Brightness<br />
</strong>The moon and Venus are fighting for the
bright name.<br />
Pick up the saber, with hair flying down, looking
very ferocious.<br />
The lonely wild goose flying high in the
sky does not join the flock.<br />
In quiet forest the wolves are competing
with each other.<br />
You have ambitions to go to a distant land,
but the timing is not right.<br />
When you don&#8217;t have plans, the fortune will
come.<br />
Might as well forget about the past and live
your old days in quietness and solitude.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The star of Three Penalties and the star of Seven Malicious Spirits shine on this life,” implies that it is easy for you to encounter trouble. Therefore, it would be wise to create good karma, to lessen the effects of any problems, before they occur. It is a good idea to leave your hometown and establish a new life somewhere else.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    Flowers “aren’t talking” refers to flowers, which have not opened, not bloomed, and it means that the time is not quite right. The time is right when the warm air returns for that is when the future appears bright (“Nightingales and flowers, the orchard and forest will be attracting”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    Luck comes during Ox years and Horse years, or it can mean during luck pillars with Ox or Horse. Life gets better as you get older.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    It is predicted that a relationship will start off well (“cloudless sky, from heaven there’s a beautiful light”). You might hit difficulties as a couple, yet it will turn out well in the end (“moon so bright”). You have friends standing by (“water fowls standing upright”).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    It is predicted that you will eventually have an outstanding child (“peach”). This wonderful child is very loving and will make a point of celebrating parents’ birthdays.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    There can be difficulties during Horse years or Ox years. Dog years tend to turn out well. Whatever is happening, you can choose to remain calm and relaxed.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The moon and Venus are fighting for a bright name,” implies that you find yourself in a competitive situation. You are spirited and want to fight, to compete (“Pick up the saber; with hair flying down, looking very ferocious”). “The lonely wild goose flying high in the sky does not join the flock,” suggests that you like to stand apart from the crowd. “In quiet forest the wolves are competing with each other,” means you face rivalry. You will succeed in the end.
