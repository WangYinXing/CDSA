<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>In this life the five elements are well
balanced and there is peace amongst the Four Pillars. Wealth is naturally at
hand and the foundation is firm. You are famous amongst neighbors.&nbsp; Your virtuous name is known to even the villages
nearby. It is only because the star you were born under offends the Heavenly Calamity,
therefore it is easy to get a hidden disease and wealth is easily lost. Throughout
your life, you put up with gossip. Even though there are a lot of Retreating
Spirits, eventually you will be rich and noble.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Attend to the orchard and forest, resulting in trees quite huge.<br />
Take care of the trees, frost and dew they
have to go through.<br />
When one day great carpenter places big axe
on huge tree,<br />
To build a phoenix palace, it will bring
great glory.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
In a strange land, noble people come to ask for you. &nbsp;<br />
In a different land, there&#8217;s a reward of gold
for you.<br />
Double strange encounters, your wishes
fulfilled for you.<br />
By the waterside you will get good tidings,
get good news.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Flowers bloom in driving rain and shocking shower.<br />
Pair of mandarin ducks is startled by the thunder.<br />
White apple blossoms, gorgeous flowers by
the water,<br />
Bright moon and cool breeze, long nights
you enjoy under.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Cherry tree several flowers blooming.<br />
When you are old, fruits are coming.<br />
Bees and butterflies fly among the green
and the yellow.<br />
Fortune and wealth without resting, around
you follow.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Riding Ox and Horse good luck bestowed.<br />
Water Rooster will bring much sorrow.<br />
Difficult to find a bosom friend,<br />
Who appreciates high mountains, where
streams flow.<br />
After the rain, fisherman will be on the go.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Flower and Willow Bring Glory Together.<br />
</strong>There will be ten thousand miles of
mountain from east to west.<br />
Whatever was in the past is not right.<br />
When the wind blows, wild goose leaves the
flock.<br />
When the rain comes the mandarin ducks fly
alone.<br />
The grass in spring blossoms, but difficult
to have fruit.<br />
In late autumn when all the leaves are gone,
there is a fruit on the branch.<br />
It is a beautiful scene with the setting
sun.<br />
Only worries are that next year the good times
do not come.</p>
