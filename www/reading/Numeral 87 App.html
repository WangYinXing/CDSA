<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>In this life, the penalty and sha qi are
heavy. There are numerous Retreating Spirits. If you do not leave your
ancestors and parents, then you will become a monk. In your life there are
golden gods and the seven arrows. Even if you want to be an easy person enjoying
leisure in bamboo courtyard and amongst pine trees, it is better to seek fame
and fortune in the busy city. Whether the load is heavy or light, you carry it
all by yourself. There is nobody to help you lessen the burden. If you can get
rid of people who grunt at you for no reason, then you can enjoy peacefulness
in a not so peaceful place.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
In southern garden and northern house enjoy
moon and good breeze.<br />
Climb the mountains before finding the gold
you can see.<br />
Home is not as good as where you get
wealthy.<br />
Live by the waterside to enjoy prosperity.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
During happy
times, there&#8217;s also something shocking.<br />
Need help
from the right person to be achieving.<br />
Don&#8217;t
lament over glory and insult in your youth.<br />
Plum
smells much better in the snow, that&#8217;s the truth.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
To the green chamber, the musical
instrument, you bring.<br />
A good time for courtship is during spring,<br />
Due to frequent winds and rain, the flower
has to leave the branch.<br />
When you want to ford the stream, you do
not have a small boat.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Late autumn three fruits ripen.<br />
The slanting branch can retain the phoenix<br />
Because of virtuous deeds of charity.<br />
Sons and daughters will be there to please.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Passing by is the white tiger.<br />
Sleep well amongst the pine trees.<br />
Recollect what you did before you wake up
in the dream.<br />
To ask for your future, go to green
mountain with clear stream.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Change your Bones to Become a Fairy<br />
</strong>You go everywhere and treat everywhere as your
home, but that is not your home.<br />
It is best to spend time in the mountains.<br />
Moon over the sea is quiet in the night.<br />
You borrow ten thousand miles of cloud like
the wild goose.<br />
Lots of fragrant flowers, but these are too
romantic.<br />
You prefer the shadows of the bamboo.<br />
You sleep whilst you are drunk, there are no
dreams.<br />
Prepare your own tea with the water from
the spring.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Be prepared for encountering setbacks (“the penalty and sha qi are heavy” and “numerous Retreating Spirits”). Remaining in your hometown means you are likely to devote yourself to spiritual development (“if you do not leave your ancestors and parents, then you will become a monk”). The “golden gods and the seven arrows” means it won’t work for you to lead a leisurely life. It works out for you to seek success, independently.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You enjoy good times (“moon and good breeze”) in many places (“southern garden and northern house”). When you overcome challenges (“climb the mountains”) you can prosper. You will find success away from your hometown.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Plum smells better in the snow, that’s the truth,” means that you enjoy your life more as you get older.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are ready for romance (“musical instrument, you bring”) when you are young (“during spring”). When you encounter difficulties in a relationship, spending time apart gives the relationship a chance to improve.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Three children are predicted. In your old age, your children will be around to keep you company (“slanting branch can retain the phoenix”) because of good karma from your charitable acts. For followers, you can attract loyal ones.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Even if there is danger you can remain calm (“passing by is the white tiger, sleep well amongst the pine trees”). Your future is promising (“green mountain with clear stream”).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can feel comfortable wherever you happen to be (“You go everywhere and treat everywhere as your home, but that is not your home”). “Moon over the sea is quiet in the night,” suggests that you do not like to attract a lot of attention. To “borrow ten thousand miles of cloud like the wild goose” means you travel long distances. You like to be practical (prefer the shadows of the bamboo”) rather than emotional (“Lots of fragrant flowers, but these are too romantic”). To “Prepare your own tea with the water from the spring” implies that you take pleasure from simple things.
