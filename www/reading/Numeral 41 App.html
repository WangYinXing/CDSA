<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>You are righteous person, straight in your
dealings, and are good at looking into the details. Your nature is both
unbiased and unselfish.&nbsp; Just like wind
and thunder can be quite exciting, so is your character. Although you are kind
at heart, you can still enjoy a bit of gossip.&nbsp;
In this life your destiny is such that you can benefit from serving a
wealthy patron in many ways. This benefactor also likes to keep your company
for wine and song in places of entertainment.&nbsp;
When it comes to doing business, your approach can be likened to &#8216;grafting
a peach branch onto a plum tree&#8217;, which is to say that you transform an
existing business into an apparently similar type of business, but it is
actually different. For instance, you might turn an existing restaurant into a
hotel, or a restaurant into a bar, or a boutique into a jeweler&#8217;s store. You
are hurt time and again because of such business strategies. There is a need to
change the leaves and roots and start again, which means you need to
fundamentally change the business into something completely different. There is
failure within success when you are changing your career all the time. However,
you are destined to be continually transforming and reforming.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Two-thirds gone from a family business you inherit,<br />
For the basis is not solid, like the
disappearing spirit.<br />
If you want to possess power go to another
land,<br />
Where, someone is waiting to give you a
hand.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
You are supported by the strength of a lady.<br />
Dog or Pig years bring success eventually.<br />
You enjoy your fortune when you&#8217;re wealthy.<br />
Kun fish turns into Peng bird makes life
easy.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
About romance, if you ask about your dreams under the pine tree,<br />
It is like the peach trees that are found in
the village.<br />
Don&#8217;t blame the mandarin ducks with their
backs to each other,<br />
When the mulberry has a gorgeous crown it&#8217;s
time for remarriage.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
In the wind and rain the peach tree blossoms.<br />
Three
flowers, one fruit preserved in autumn,<br />
Get
blessings due to your good deeds in the past.<br />
An heir
to plant pine trees, family business can last.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Worries turn into joy in years of Dog and Ox<br />
In Dragon year beware of shocking events.<br />
Start of Tiger or end of Snake year maybe worries.<br />
A quiet suburban life suits you in
retirement,<br />
Some place with wild animals and pine trees.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Withered Fairy Crane Flying over the Clouds<br />
</strong>Big
things spring from small things.<br />
Pine trees
grow on the mountain with the green lichen.<br />
You need
to go away to a faraway place to settle down and live happily.<br />
A good
start often loses steam leading to a lot on your mind, enthusiasm does not
last.<br />
When the
wild goose lands on the river bank, there is not much water, and very little to
support life.<br />
The mandarin
ducks are happy together, but all of a sudden they are shocked to leave.<br />
If you
want to ask about the future, two trees blossom, and there is one fruit, meaning
two marriages and one son.</p>

Grain rain period is
one jie (a seasonal point) and is usually on 20 April.</p>
