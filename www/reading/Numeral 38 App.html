<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>You are born with the ability to plan and
organize. The foundation of your life is built on diligence. You are not afraid
of hard work. Unfortunately, you are born with the Retreating Spirit, which
means that when you are supposed to advance, there is no advancement. When you
are supposed to be worried, you appear to be quite happy. In your early years
you have to work hard. &nbsp;You go through
many pairs of shoes because of how far you have walked.&nbsp; When you are supposed to be happy it ends up
with you grumbling. When everything should be right, it becomes awful. Siblings
become sworn enemies, like neighboring countries locked in a conflict,
constantly at war. You even fall out with your parents. You do a lot of
thinking in the morning, but you are laughing in the evening. Remember to keep your
larder in your house well stocked with the seven essential ingredients (firewood,
rice, oil, salt, soy sauce, vinegar and tea) for preparing a meal. If you want
to be comfortable you need to change your career.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Worries and danger, no luck early on,<br />
Just
like when the clouds block the moon.<br />
Go you must, a distant place, play your
song,<br />
To serve someone who likes your tune.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
In Horse or Ox year meet someone, born in year of Jia or Bing.<br />
Snake year&#8217;s difficult, so request from
this person his blessing.<br />
He is the one who can bring you a good
position.<br />
Then you&#8217;re like a phoenix flying over
dangerous gate, no hesitation.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Wind blows fast with mild rain in cold
spring.<br />
Nightingale
outside your door, a duet it won&#8217;t sing.<br />
Young
love, for you, no such thing.<br />
Opportunities
for marriage come in mid-life, your autumn.<br />
In later
years mandarin ducks play in clear pond, a twosome.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
When you are right under the green pine tree,<br />
You offer decaying flowers, with fallen
petals, your sympathy.<br />
Deep along the path lined with cinnamon and
mulberry,<br />
On the east wall there a fruit enjoying spring
breeze.<br />
One son comes late, he is extraordinary.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Geng Shen year meeting Bing or Ji,
opportunity.<br />
In Snake
year you hear a call from the south fairy.<br />
Past
events are like dreams that are empty.<br />
As time
flows, the cuckoo calls, it&#8217;s time to leave.</p>
<p><strong>Style:
The Moon Shining Over the Floating Cloud<br />
</strong>When you encounter difficulties in life
there is always a direction to go.<br />
Everybody knows the floating cloud makes
the bright moon dim.<br />
When there are blossoms at midnight, it is
better not to have wind.<br />
Wild goose flying over the big river cannot
even see its shadow.<br />
Do not plant flowers in your old garden.<br />
Instead go to a faraway land to plant the
evergreen pine.<br />
You should know that when you come to a
well with spring water, one peach tree will be so glorious it makes the bare
tree seem in bloom.<br />
Like one tree making two trees appear red, what
you achieve will be widely known. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “You are born with the Retreating Spirit” means that your luck is such that you encounter setbacks when you want to move forwards. To keep your larder well stocked with the seven essential ingredients is a metaphor, reminding you about the importance of being well prepared.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “No luck early on, just like when clouds block the moon,” suggests you face difficulties when you are young. You can leave your hometown to move far away and find work. An employer (“someone who likes your tune”) values your skills.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    Someone who was in a Jia year was born in a year ending with digit 4, such as 1954, 1964, 1974, 1984, 1994, etc. Bing years are those ending with digit 6, such as 1956, 1966, 1976, 1986, 1996, etc. You can meet a helpful person who was born in a Jia year or a Bing year. Ask for support from this helpful person during a Snake year when you are facing difficulties and you can soar over barriers (“like a phoenix flying over dangerous gate”).
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are unlikely to find true love and get married when you are young. “Wind blows fast with mild rain in cold spring” alludes to romance luck being difficult when you are young (springtime). You are likely to find a happy marriage in mid-life (autumn).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can encounter difficulties when it comes to having children and you need to remain patient. Eventually, you will be fortunate (“path lined with cinnamon and mulberry”) and you will have an extraordinary son (“on the east wall there is a fruit enjoying spring breeze”). For followers, you will have capable followers, in the end.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    A Geng Shen year occurs every 60 years. Examples of Geng Shen years are 1920, 1980, 2040, etc. Bing years are those ending with digit 6, such as 1996, 2006, 2016, 2026 etc. Ji years end with digit 9, such as 1999, 2009, 2019, 2029 etc. “In Geng Shen year meeting Bing or Ji, opportunity” suggests that someone born in a Bing year or a Ji year could bring you an opportunity in a Geng Shen year.  In a Snake year you are likely to leave the past behind you and move on in some way.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can have better luck when you move away from your hometown. You will gain a reputation for being successful.
