<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>In this life you are born clever, frank and
open.&nbsp; There is early training in dealing
with life that comes from overcoming challenges. When it comes to finding out about
making necessary changes, it might be too late.&nbsp;
Relatives turn a cold face to you, as if there is snow even in late
spring, when you expect it to be warm. Although you are lucky enough to have children
and grandchildren your relationship with them is not that intimate, they are
like the image of flowers in mirror. &nbsp;You
may feel there is a lack of real sentiment. Nothing substantial can be
accomplished because your mind is often undecided on whether to go forwards or
back. You can be wasting time on contemplating too much; that is your destiny.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Don&#8217;t blame people when their love for
you is not durable.<br />
Several
layers of fame and fortune make you admirable.<br />
Years of
Goat, Dog, Horse, laugh and point at mulberry tree,<br />
At these
good times your family name carries much glory.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Make good use of what you have to elevate your family.<br />
In Rooster and Dog years name spreads far
and wide.<br />
Praise from music classroom flows freely
outside.<br />
Feel happy under bright moon with cool
breeze beside.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Pairs of mandarin ducks in big pond playing.<br />
Water fowl all flock together in the
evening.<br />
Such a merry social life, very entertaining,<br />
At home under bright moon, cool breeze
blowing.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
After the rain, wind is quiet, fruits
find it frightening.<br />
Strange
flower brings heavenly peach in evening,<br />
Means in
your later years, baby son will be arriving.<br />
Banquet
in gold and jade hall, children dancing and singing.<br />
Later, poetry
and propriety, lots of descendants are learning.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Retire up the mountain at times of Tiger or Monkey.<br />
Appreciate the beauty of the scenery in the
valley.<br />
Crowing bird arouses you from your dreams,<br />
Baboon and crane want to go, yet find it&#8217;s
not easy.<br />
Realize awake from dream, time to go back
to reality.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Solitary Wild Goose Carrying the Letter<br />
</strong>Reflection of water in well distorts the
stars in the sky.<br />
For half of your life your wealth and worldly
possessions are not satisfactory.<br />
Mandarin ducks are too lazy to dance under
the midnight moon.<br />
Willow tree sees sadness at midnight in
autumn.<br />
Solitary wild goose brings a lot of
melancholy.<br />
Good days of achievement come late. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
The noble people, bringing you success, will
come from Kun and Li palaces,<br />
Leading the way to go, to the white jade
pavilion together.</p>
