<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>Like the orchids blossoming on rocks and
the pine and cedar growing well on the mountain, your talents are not seen. You
live in a place which is far away from the crowd. There are no strong roots. Even
though your grandfather was wealthy, unfortunately, you were not born during
that time period. By the time you were born the wealth had faded. Relatives
cannot give you much of a hand and your siblings behave like strangers.&nbsp; Your destiny implies that you could suffer
childhood injuries. To avoid being disabled, you could be a little boy who is
dressed up as a girl, or your parents may choose to hand you over for adoption
into the care of another family. You have to trust that a sweet melon eventually
carries a bit of bitterness. There is nothing perfect in the world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Rain
falls on peach blossom outside the wall.<br />
When you
bring it in, not the same at all,<br />
It will
be an entirely different life.<br />
When you
sail along the west moon river,<br />
How many
friends understand you better?<br />
Ancestral
business, do not rely on,<br />
And
support from friends, do not count upon.<br />
Behave
like a tiger or a dragon,<br />
Work
hard and start a family again.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Recognition will be received one day,<br />
Become rich and famous in a big way.<br />
Dog years you will start to enjoy fortune.<br />
Where will you gain proper recognition?<br />
It will be someplace that is far away.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Keep the blind closed, swallow cannot come in and dance.<br />
In early years, no interest in marriage or
romance.<br />
Outside, nightingale remains on the willow
tree.<br />
Autumn cinnamon has a good scent from the
rocks,<br />
Don&#8217;t say the day is late and blossom is
not pretty,<br />
It&#8217;s not like the peach in spring, still
time to marry.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
When you are young you have two marriages.<br />
If there&#8217;s one
fruit, already too many.<br />
Time flies and it
is autumn already,<br />
You can sing to
your young son cheerfully.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
When you ask when is the returning path?<br />
Then you know it is Rabbit or Monkey.<br />
What&#8217;s beyond? At the bridgehead, you can see.<br />
On the west river, boats sail fast at night.<br />
Go take the boat instead of being bound in
bitterness city,<br />
Go find a doctor when you&#8217;re sick in old
age, quickly, quickly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Wild Goose Losing the Flock<br />
</strong>On the horizon there is water and sky joining
together.<br />
Over the sea the wild goose has missed the
flock.<br />
Back-stabbing is everywhere.<br />
Fame and fortune is changing all the time.<br />
At present the affluence is not real
affluence.<br />
In the later days, the poverty is not real
poverty, for you have good friends.<br />
There is someone by the river to share happy
times and find entertainment in music and dancing in the jade palace. &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “To avoid being disabled, you could be a little boy who is dressed up as a girl, or your parents may choose to hand you over for adoption into the care of another family,” refers to some old Chinese customs, whereby bad luck in childhood could be overcome as described. In a modern context, it means that if as a child your carers were people other than your birth parents then it was fortunate. “You have to trust that a sweet melon eventually carries a bit of bitterness” implies that life can be pleasurable, yet there are some sad moments.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Rain falls on peach blossom outside the wall. When you bring it in, not the same at all,” suggests that your life is not as it appears on the outside. “When you sail along the west moon river, how many friends understand you better” implies that you cannot count on support from your friends.  “Behave like a tiger or dragon, work hard and start a family again” means you can be brave about building a new life.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    Eventually, you will have fame and fortune somewhere far away from your hometown. Good times are likely to start with a Dog year.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are not interested in settling down when you are young (“swallow cannot come in and dance”). There are romantic opportunities (“nightingale remains on the willow tree”) and you will marry late (“Autumn cinnamon has good scent”).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    A fruit refers to a son. You are likely to have a son when you are older. For followers, they will come to you later in life.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Be careful of your health during a Rabbit year or a Monkey year. If you feel unwell in old age, you need to act promptly and find a doctor whether it is day or night (“On the west river, boats sail fast at night”).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Over the sea, the wild goose has missed the flock” suggests you do some things on your own. You can still enjoy good times with friends, even when you are not wealthy.
