<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>It is not just a lonesome life, but also
one where your relatives feel you bring bad luck to them, because the timing of
your birth coincided with something untoward happening. It is important for you
to find the positive features from any shortcomings. &nbsp;If you are a man, when it comes to
marriage, instead of your wife moving in with your family, you move to become
part of your wife&#8217;s family<sup>1</sup>.&nbsp; To avoid bad luck, you should hand over your
son to be adopted by your brother.&nbsp; Your
destiny is such that you are not meant to become the guardian of the family
business. In the early days you experience difficulties, yet you can get rich
late. Before you are really old, the grey hairs come out on your head. There is
much ado about nothing.&nbsp; In this life,
you want to do so much that it feels like there are thousands of things which
cannot be accomplished.&nbsp; There are three
things that are left open-ended in your life: the debts you bring to your
parents, the karmic debts from when you cursed the Buddha in a previous life,
the debts from raising your children. When you see Buddha you are angry and do
not worship Buddha. If you want to be successful in the end, you must accept failure
in the beginning. From the root of the Chinese goldthread<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;plant, grows the licorice root. Who believes sweetness comes from bitterness. &nbsp;</p>

<p>Footnote 1<br />
In traditional Chinese
culture, when a couple marry, the woman goes to live with the husband&#8217;s
family.&nbsp; If a man moves in with the
wife&#8217;s family, he becomes part of that family and any children will take on the
wife&#8217;s surname.&nbsp; A wealthy family with
only daughters (and no sons) would often seek a son-in-law, usually from a less
affluent family, to marry and move in with them.</p>
