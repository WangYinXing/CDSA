<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>In this life, power comes from your ability
to kow-tow to your superiors and to flatter them. When you examine yourself, you
find a lot of shortcomings, yet your appearance exudes authority, so it is a
case of style over substance. Although you can make an effort, be aware that it
is often in vain. Some of the things you start, you never finish. Wealth is
like floating clouds and you never know when it will be dispersed. Those close
to you are like leaves in autumn, which are shed and blown away by the
wind.&nbsp; Like a lone general fighting on the
frontline, you cannot scare the enemy. Destiny tells you everything will be delayed.
Do not complain about the good luck coming late.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Those who are strangers become close.<br />
Those who are close in distance grow.<br />
Leave the south, go north to live happily.<br />
In a distant land, cinnamon and mulberry bloom.<br />
It is fitting to go forwards to find your fortune.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
People rely on me and I rely on them.<br />
Early days soon come to an end.<br />
Eventually, meet the real noble person,<br />
Helps spread fame far and wide for certain.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Mandarin ducks play in the water happily.<br />
In the late years, one swims individually.<br />
No meaning in the shapes the white cloud
makes.<br />
The lonely moon is shining over the five
lakes.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Flowers wither to leave fruits when spring is done.<br />
One by one watch the fruits ripen.<br />
Dragon and Dog years bring good children,<br />
Who rise to the top, have great accomplishment.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Age nine by nine is right time to go,<br />
Pig and Goat years, luck does not flow.<br />
Kind person, live a life full of mercy,<br />
Therefore a lot of fortune in your destiny,<br />
You smile in the forest where there&#8217;s a
stream,<br />
Enjoying spring breeze as if it&#8217;s good
wine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Nightingale Singing in East Wind<br />
</strong>Strangers become close friends, close
friends become distant from you.<br />
Take the branch from north and the south, a
lot of work.<br />
You belong to the mountains, so you will
live in the suburbs.<br />
Mandarin ducks playing in water eventually will
have to part.<br />
Wild goose who has missed the flock will
receive tidings.<br />
Good times come and leave in the evening in
the valley.<br />
One son will wear golden clothes a symbol
of achievement</p>
