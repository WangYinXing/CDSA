<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>In this life, power comes from your ability
to kow-tow to your superiors and to flatter them. When you examine yourself, you
find a lot of shortcomings, yet your appearance exudes authority, so it is a
case of style over substance. Although you can make an effort, be aware that it
is often in vain. Some of the things you start, you never finish. Wealth is
like floating clouds and you never know when it will be dispersed. Those close
to you are like leaves in autumn, which are shed and blown away by the
wind.&nbsp; Like a lone general fighting on the
frontline, you cannot scare the enemy. Destiny tells you everything will be delayed.
Do not complain about the good luck coming late.</p>
<strong><br clear="all" />
</strong>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Those who are strangers become close.<br />
Those who are close in distance grow.<br />
Leave the south, go north to live happily.<br />
In a distant land, cinnamon and mulberry bloom.<br />
It is fitting to go forwards to find your fortune.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
People rely on me and I rely on them.<br />
Early days soon come to an end.<br />
Eventually, meet the real noble person,<br />
Helps spread fame far and wide for certain.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Mandarin ducks play in the water happily.<br />
In the late years, one swims individually.<br />
No meaning in the shapes the white cloud
makes.<br />
The lonely moon is shining over the five
lakes.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Flowers wither to leave fruits when spring is done.<br />
One by one watch the fruits ripen.<br />
Dragon and Dog years bring good children,<br />
Who rise to the top, have great accomplishment.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Age nine by nine is right time to go,<br />
Pig and Goat years, luck does not flow.<br />
Kind person, live a life full of mercy,<br />
Therefore a lot of fortune in your destiny,<br />
You smile in the forest where there&#8217;s a
stream,<br />
Enjoying spring breeze as if it&#8217;s good
wine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Nightingale Singing in East Wind<br />
</strong>Strangers become close friends, close
friends become distant from you.<br />
Take the branch from north and the south, a
lot of work.<br />
You belong to the mountains, so you will
live in the suburbs.<br />
Mandarin ducks playing in water eventually will
have to part.<br />
Wild goose who has missed the flock will
receive tidings.<br />
Good times come and leave in the evening in
the valley.<br />
One son will wear golden clothes a symbol
of achievement</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Since you give out an air of authority, make the most of it. Be patient in waiting for good fortune to come your way.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Leave the south, go north to live happily” implies that you are better off moving to a distant land, the directions south and north do not necessarily apply. You will prosper (”cinnamon and mulberry bloom”) when you follow through on your motivation to go somewhere faraway.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    You might need to meet many people before you encounter the benefactor/mentor who can help you gain a good reputation.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    A happy relationship is predicted (“mandarin ducks play”). “No meaning in the shapes the white cloud makes” suggests that there is no need to look to the heavens for answers. In your later years you will enjoy your own company.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are likely to have children, but not too early (“when spring is done”). Those born in the year of the Dragon or the year of the Dog turn out to be extremely successful. For followers, your most accomplished followers are those born in a Dragon year or a Dog year.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    A long life is predicted. Be cautious during Pig years and Goat years. However, you can overcome difficulties because of the good karma you created with your merciful attitude. You know how to enjoy life (“smile in the forest…”).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Take a branch from north and the south, a lot of work” implies you are busy going back and forth doing a lot of work. The directions do not necessarily apply. You have an affinity for the countryside (“belong to the mountains”). “Wild goose who has missed the flock will receive tidings,” suggests that you will hear from your family when you are away from them. “Good times come and leave in the evening in the valley” suggests there is enjoyment in your later years (evening).
