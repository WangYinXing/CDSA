<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>In this life you feel so tied up with
worries, it is as if you cannot move. &nbsp;Entangled
in a web of love and hate, you waste a lot of energy over disagreements. You
want to arrive at the destination, but the destination is too far away and you
have wasted your energy and time.&nbsp;All your relatives are like burning charcoal
placed on ice, they cannot help you. Children are like ephemeral flowers before
your eyes. Beware of a traitor who is a blood relative. There will be fighting
among siblings in the family. During middle age there are lots of ups and downs.
A lot of barriers and misfortune bother you all the time. Work hard until your
hair turns grey, after all hardship you can enjoy a stable and peaceful life.</p>

<strong>Luck Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
First
half of your life you&#8217;re lost and aimless.<br />
Efforts
sink in a grass boat, achieved no purpose.<br />
In time,
gold is refined, jade is polished.<br />
You
visit emperor and empress in palace,<br />
Later
years, fame and fortune accomplished.</p>
<p>Life Path:&nbsp;<br />
Like the good craftsman busy carving,<br />
In the end you&#8217;ve created something.<br />
Rat and Ox years will be amazing.<br />
A good name, Tiger and Dragon bring.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
From behind the clouds, comes bright
moon,<br />
It is
like the beautiful lady is on the moon.<br />
Bless
children by doing charitable deeds.<br />
Best times
are found in the evening clouds.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Branch about to blossom, flowers are ready,<br />
Yet wind and rain makes them feel wary.<br />
Remember about doing deeds for charity,<br />
For it will help your children to succeed.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
End of Snake and beginning of Horse is not the right time.<br />
Don&#8217;t cross the bridge, don&#8217;t leave home
before your prime.<br />
On the empty boat in the wilderness, there&#8217;s
nobody sailing.<br />
Plum and willow are laughing at the
flurries, laughing in spring.</p>
<p><br />

<p><strong>Style:
Wedding Mirror Being Polished<br />
</strong>When the wedding mirror is covered with
dust, it has lost its luster.<br />
Re-polish it to make it bright again.<br />
Hate coming out of love is already a fact.<br />
How can the broken mirror become complete
again?<br />
Remember you met the noble person who was
laughing.<br />
And you followed the woodcutter into the
forest in a bamboo raincoat.<br />
Old pine tree does not change its habit of
standing in rain and frost.<br />
Even on the high mountain the new shoots
are coming out.</p>
