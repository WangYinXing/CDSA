<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>In this life you feel so tied up with
worries, it is as if you cannot move. &nbsp;Entangled
in a web of love and hate, you waste a lot of energy over disagreements. You
want to arrive at the destination, but the destination is too far away and you
have wasted your energy and time.&nbsp;All your relatives are like burning charcoal
placed on ice, they cannot help you. Children are like ephemeral flowers before
your eyes. Beware of a traitor who is a blood relative. There will be fighting
among siblings in the family. During middle age there are lots of ups and downs.
A lot of barriers and misfortune bother you all the time. Work hard until your
hair turns grey, after all hardship you can enjoy a stable and peaceful life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Luck Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
First
half of your life you&#8217;re lost and aimless.<br />
Efforts
sink in a grass boat, achieved no purpose.<br />
In time,
gold is refined, jade is polished.<br />
You
visit emperor and empress in palace,<br />
Later
years, fame and fortune accomplished.</p>
<p>Life Path:&nbsp;<br />
Like the good craftsman busy carving,<br />
In the end you&#8217;ve created something.<br />
Rat and Ox years will be amazing.<br />
A good name, Tiger and Dragon bring.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
From behind the clouds, comes bright
moon,<br />
It is
like the beautiful lady is on the moon.<br />
Bless
children by doing charitable deeds.<br />
Best times
are found in the evening clouds.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Branch about to blossom, flowers are ready,<br />
Yet wind and rain makes them feel wary.<br />
Remember about doing deeds for charity,<br />
For it will help your children to succeed.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
End of Snake and beginning of Horse is not the right time.<br />
Don&#8217;t cross the bridge, don&#8217;t leave home
before your prime.<br />
On the empty boat in the wilderness, there&#8217;s
nobody sailing.<br />
Plum and willow are laughing at the
flurries, laughing in spring.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Wedding Mirror Being Polished<br />
</strong>When the wedding mirror is covered with
dust, it has lost its luster.<br />
Re-polish it to make it bright again.<br />
Hate coming out of love is already a fact.<br />
How can the broken mirror become complete
again?<br />
Remember you met the noble person who was
laughing.<br />
And you followed the woodcutter into the
forest in a bamboo raincoat.<br />
Old pine tree does not change its habit of
standing in rain and frost.<br />
Even on the high mountain the new shoots
are coming out.</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “End of Snake and beginning of Horse is not the right time. Don’t cross the bridge, don’t leave home before your prime,” means the best time to leave your hometown is during your prime years. Snake and Horse are referring to the prime stage of your life. “On an empty boat in the wilderness, there’s nobody sailing,” implies that you would not get very far if you left home before the time is right. “Plum and willow are laughing at the flurries, laughing in spring,” suggests that in your later years (when there are flurries of snow) you have a very enjoyable time, as if you were young again (“laughing in spring”).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    The first four lines of the verse are suggesting that you need to repair a broken relationship. “Remember you met the noble person who was laughing.
And you followed the woodcutter into the forest in a bamboo raincoat,” means there are helpful people to lead the way in times of adversity. When you face challenges with determination (“old pine tree does not change its habit of standing in the rain and frost”) there is hope for a new start (“new shoots are coming out”).
