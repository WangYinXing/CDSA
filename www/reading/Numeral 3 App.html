<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>
In technical matters you are a star.&nbsp; Cultural or academic success can be achieved.
When you want to be alone, you cannot. When you want to socialize and be with
people you cannot. In difficult times what appears to be a disaster is not a
disaster. In times of achievement, good fortune is not really good fortune. A
noble and respectable person you are the target of jealousy by lesser mortals.
Setting a good example you make a good role model. When you are relaxed you can
still find things to make you feel uncomfortable. When you are happy you can
still find reasons to be sad.&nbsp; You have
siblings and friends, yet it is as if they are not there. Relatives are not
close to you. Everything is accomplished by yourself, on your own, that is how
it is in your life.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
From the
terrace you watch the bright moon.<br />
On the
high mountain alone you climb.<br />
Unfulfilled
dreams are dropped along the way.<br />
You seek
peace in the battlefield of your mind.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Looking back you see the whole country,<br />
Thousands
of miles away from home.<br />
In old
age you reflect on shame and glory.<br />
Let it be, do not lament on your life story.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Will a wedding banquet full of luxury,<br />
Lead to satisfaction
or misery? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Happy or sad, it
is hard to foresee.<br />
To harvest fruit, re-plant the apricot tree.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Beautiful flowers adorn the back
garden, yet no fruit,<br />
The lovely greenery blossoming and
blooming.<br />
Chances are Goat and Tiger years bring offspring.<br />
Handsome fruit on the mulberry tree
reflects the glory of sunset.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Dragon year opportunities come with
dragon on water.<br />
Retirement happens in Tiger year, even
without plans.<br />
With cool breeze and bright moon for quiet
times.<br />
With pets and plants you enjoy the rural
life.</p>
<p><strong>Style:
A Horse Going Through Mountain and River<br />
</strong>High winds blow over a thousand miles,<br />
Causing ripples of stormy waters.<br />
With great ambition for many great things,<br />
You are like a goose soaring on powerful
wings.<br />
Just as a pine tree stands firmly upright
in the snow,<br />
When you seek wealth both success and
failure you will know.<br />
Planting beautiful flowers in spring,<br />
Soon you will enjoy being melancholy.<br />
If you want to know what future success you
will get,<br />
Imagine you are in fairyland picking a
peach at sunset.&nbsp;</p>
<div>Footnote 1&nbsp;<br />
The original text says
riding on a donkey, because in ancient China this was the most impressive way
to lead a procession through town.

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Success can be achieved and you can do it on your own terms. 
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    Watching the bright moon from the terrace means a bright future is ahead. You can climb to the top alone. Let go of any dreams that do not work out. Discover ways to find peace of mind.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    When you look back on your life you have travelled far and wide. There were good times and bad times. Be accepting of what happened.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    A glamorous start to a marriage is not a guarantee of long-lasting happiness. It is difficult to predict how the marriage will work out.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    You may need to wait for children to arrive. The most likely years for children to be born are Goat and Tiger years. You can be proud of your children. If you do not have children, you could encounter loyal followers in Goat and Tiger Years.  
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    There could be good opportunities coming in a Dragon year. Dragon on water hints at water being involved somehow. You are likely to retire during a Tiger year and enjoy a peaceful life.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are ambitious and can fly high in your career. Just like the pine tree can get through winter, you can cope with challenges. There will be those projects which succeed, so do not dwell on what does not work out. You can lay the foundations of your success in your youth (springtime). You can have great accomplishment. To be able to pick a peach in fairyland means you will have sensational success.
