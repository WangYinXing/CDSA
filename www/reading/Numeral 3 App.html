<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>In technical matters you are a star.&nbsp; Cultural or academic success can be achieved.
When you want to be alone, you cannot. When you want to socialize and be with
people you cannot. In difficult times what appears to be a disaster is not a
disaster. In times of achievement, good fortune is not really good fortune. A
noble and respectable person you are the target of jealousy by lesser mortals.
Setting a good example you make a good role model. When you are relaxed you can
still find things to make you feel uncomfortable. When you are happy you can
still find reasons to be sad.&nbsp; You have
siblings and friends, yet it is as if they are not there. Relatives are not
close to you. Everything is accomplished by yourself, on your own, that is how
it is in your life.&nbsp; </p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
From the
terrace you watch the bright moon.<br />
On the
high mountain alone you climb.<br />
Unfulfilled
dreams are dropped along the way.<br />
You seek
peace in the battlefield of your mind.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Looking back you see the whole country,<br />
Thousands
of miles away from home.<br />
In old
age you reflect on shame and glory.<br />
Let it be, do not lament on your life story.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Will a wedding banquet full of luxury,<br />
Lead to satisfaction
or misery? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
Happy or sad, it
is hard to foresee.<br />
To harvest fruit, re-plant the apricot tree.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Beautiful flowers adorn the back
garden, yet no fruit,<br />
The lovely greenery blossoming and
blooming.<br />
Chances are Goat and Tiger years bring offspring.<br />
Handsome fruit on the mulberry tree
reflects the glory of sunset.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Dragon year opportunities come with
dragon on water.<br />
Retirement happens in Tiger year, even
without plans.<br />
With cool breeze and bright moon for quiet
times.<br />
With pets and plants you enjoy the rural
life.</p>
<p><strong>Style:
A Horse Going Through Mountain and River<br />
</strong>High winds blow over a thousand miles,<br />
Causing ripples of stormy waters.<br />
With great ambition for many great things,<br />
You are like a goose soaring on powerful
wings.<br />
Just as a pine tree stands firmly upright
in the snow,<br />
When you seek wealth both success and
failure you will know.<br />
Planting beautiful flowers in spring,<br />
Soon you will enjoy being melancholy.<br />
If you want to know what future success you
will get,<br />
Imagine you are in fairyland picking a
peach at sunset.&nbsp;</p>

riding on a donkey, because in ancient China this was the most impressive way
to lead a procession through town.
