<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This is the life of an admiral, general or
minister. In the old days it would be someone who was an assistant to the
emperor. Nowadays you can be somebody who helps to run the country. You are
talented in both literary arts and military or fighting techniques.&nbsp; Your nature is unselfish, with a character which
is hard and soft at the same time. Capabilities are very good for rescuing and
liberating people. Sometimes you meet fortune, yet sometimes you meet
misfortune. Wealth is adequate throughout your life. You can expect to live a
long life. Competing and winning are what you love to do. You can distinguish
what is right from what is wrong.&nbsp; If you
choose a spouse who has the luck to escape from danger and withstand pain, it
will bring you extra longevity too.&nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Gold and jade are not real treasures
to be counted on.<br />
Being
yourself with a peaceful heart is the best medicine.<br />
In Dog
and Dragon years, there will be prosperity,<br />
Because
meeting the right person at right time will be lucky.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Fortune runs with a pair of Ox tails, as it happens.<br />
At Rat&#8217;s head and Tiger&#8217;s tail, contentment,<br />
Success, not as great as the previous
generation,<br />
Anyhow, still receive an award in the
imperial palace,<br />
It&#8217;s an achievement still worthy of
congratulation.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Fan made of goose feathers looks like a dragon&#8217;s tail.<br />
Alone in grand hall, stands a lady with
jade beauty.<br />
Into great wealth and social status, you
can marry.<br />
Keep a peaceful mind, keep it flat and
even, like a level trail.<br />
Matchmaker under the moon will do what&#8217;s
right, without fail.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Famous tree blossoms, many fruits it bears,<br />
Green
and yellow fruits are coming in pairs.<br />
In late
years, a lot of grandchildren,<br />
Many
babies are born in your grand mansion.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Encounter the powerful people in days of difficulty.<br />
Like going into a dream, leave this world,
eventually.<br />
It&#8217;s not the water rooster that can be
haunting.<br />
Yet it still stirs up the peaceful life,
stirring, stirring.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
One After Another Millstones Grinding Jade<br />
</strong>Stars above are emitting light like arrows
shooting from heaven.<br />
The moon is shining on the heavenly book, which
reveals the secrets of life, as it descends to earth from the sky.<br />
In the Rooster hour, rooster crows three
times, reminding you to go on an important trip, to approach the emperor in the
north.<br />
The bright full moon is coming out in the
east.<br />
If you want to polish your sword you need
to find the right stone.<br />
If you want to refine the jade, there is no
need to fear the powerful grinding instruments.<br />
Focus on what you want to target.<br />
Then you shoot the arrow to aim at the
phoenix.</p>
