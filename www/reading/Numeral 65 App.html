<p><strong>Destiny<br />
</strong>This life is like a lonely cloud coming
over the mountain, like a house in the wilderness riding the wind. Your heart
is everywhere and your mind is not here. Establish yourself in a strange land doing
business elsewhere. You plant a pine on east bank and appreciate its beauty
from the west bank. Planting bamboo in south garden, then enjoy the shade in
north garden. Wherever you get wealthy, you will return to your hometown to
build a house. Your parents are like visiting guests and siblings are like
fading stars. You don&#8217;t love the pleasures of your homeland. Wherever you can
do well, you can make that place your home.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
No need
to weigh the gold when there&#8217;s a bucketful.<br />
Money is
external and it can bring trouble.<br />
In your
hometown the fields you own may be several.<br />
Better
to dress up and move up to jade hall, leave as soon you&#8217;re able.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Work very hard, in middle age become
successful.<br />
Enjoy music and dancing in extravagant
hall,<br />
Borrow strength and power from another to
become noble.<br />
In the end you&#8217;ll lose their support, so be
careful.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Moon shines over deep forest and moon
sleeps there.<br />
Mandarin
ducks parted for some time, no longer a pair.<br />
Can find
another spouse, can find a love to share, can make a new bond,<br />
For amongst
all the water fowl, a beautiful red lotus grows in the green pond.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Two trees blossom, two fruits, that&#8217;s two sons.<br />
Outside the wall,
another fruit, another son.<br />
In late years, orchids
and cinnamon resplendent. &nbsp;<br />
Magnificent jade
hall, full of your descendants.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
At start of Ox or end of Horse year it&#8217;s time to go.<br />
Not found green mountains and blue water
though.<br />
Life can be just like an empty dream, you
know,<br />
But people can constantly remember the hero.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Phoenix Sleeping on Maple<br />
</strong>Heart is undecided to move forward or to
step back.<br />
Worldly affairs are like playing chess with
a fairy.<br />
In the cold wind wild goose casts a shadow
on the ground.<br />
The evening rain on the maple tree makes a
solitary sound.<br />
A lot of trees cannot provide you with a
shading canopy.<br />
Unintentionally planted flowers become a
forest.<br />
Because of the woodcutter pointing you to the
right way, you will get to the white land picking up gold.</p>
