<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>Your life is peaceful, it is like the spring wind blowing
on your face. Everyone is your friend. You are very ambitious.&nbsp; You know the long and short of it, and you
know what is serious and what is light-hearted. Able to negotiate well, you are
a good mediator. In times of difficulty, you know how to solve problems.&nbsp; You can run a business in hard times.
Although you are impatient, you are kind-hearted and there is never anything
evil in your heart.&nbsp; Nobody can say you
lack good taste, even if you live in a shabby house, you appreciate music, art,
playing chess and reading books. Your sense of refinement is such that it is
important to you to wear good jewelry of gold and jade, even if you do not
possess the finest robes. You hope everything is in order, but unfortunately,
there are setbacks in your life. However, when facing adversity you only need
to be firm and true to yourself, then spring will come and the flowers will
blossom. </p>
