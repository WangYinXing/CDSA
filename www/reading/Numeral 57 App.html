<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This is a person who is like a tall tree
that stands upright. Your spirit is like the lonely moon in the sky. You are
sincere about everything and your character is honorable. There is a lack of
harmony among your siblings and these are not good relationships. Being
enthusiastic in everything you do, creates gossip around you. When others take
advantage of you, it makes you angry. When you are true to others it doesn&#8217;t
work out. Minding other people&#8217;s business will only bring you worries. Whatever
has a good result in the end must encounter a lot of difficulties along the
way. Everything that you start is filled with enthusiasm, but you lack stamina
to see things through to the end. When you are supposed to be leisurely, your
mind is very busy. When the situation appears to be calm you are worried deep
inside your heart. Don&#8217;t blame destiny that luck is not always with you.</p>
