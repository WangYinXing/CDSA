<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This is a person who is like a tall tree
that stands upright. Your spirit is like the lonely moon in the sky. You are
sincere about everything and your character is honorable. There is a lack of
harmony among your siblings and these are not good relationships. Being
enthusiastic in everything you do, creates gossip around you. When others take
advantage of you, it makes you angry. When you are true to others it doesn&#8217;t
work out. Minding other people&#8217;s business will only bring you worries. Whatever
has a good result in the end must encounter a lot of difficulties along the
way. Everything that you start is filled with enthusiasm, but you lack stamina
to see things through to the end. When you are supposed to be leisurely, your
mind is very busy. When the situation appears to be calm you are worried deep
inside your heart. Don&#8217;t blame destiny that luck is not always with you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
About your career, no need to worry.<br />
Like green pine tree and cedar you stand gracefully.<br />
More than enough land for growing crops,<br />
Plant some mulberry and other trees.<br />
Fragrant cinnamon from one tree in the
field,<br />
Means one of many businesses gives an outstanding
yield.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Once you start, you&#8217;ll enjoy staying
in your career.<br />
Dawn of
a good era, every Rooster year.<br />
When you
are old, from the right direction wind does blow.<br />
Great
success, up to the top of the forest you go.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
When successful a spouse will be with you.<br />
When mandarin ducks fly apart along the way,<br />
Still plenty of admirers you see in the day.<br />
Under bright moon and cool breeze wait for
cuckoo.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
In your garden, fresh fruit hangs from
tree,<br />
However,
wind is strong and rain is heavy.<br />
Flowers might not be able to withstand
weather.<br />
Help cultivate fruits by doing a lot of
good deeds,<br />
Then, it will be like dragon and phoenix flying
to heaven.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Brooks and streams flow over luxuriant
rocks.<br />
Enjoy
the beauty of nature here, good place to stay. &nbsp;<br />
Monkey
and crane, great chums to each other in a land far away.<br />
Eventually,
live in suburbs with good friends for company.<br />
Fisherman
rows boat through fairyland of peach trees.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Rain Hitting the Lotus<br />
</strong>This
life is born without luck.<br />
The wind
is hitting the lotus flowers<br />
Wild
geese do not love each other and separate.<br />
Loving
mandarin ducks refuse to fly away from each other.<br />
In the Li palace fire is so strong wood is
burned to charcoal.<br />
In Dui palace metal grows and takes root.<br />
You worry about the red petals flying in
the wind.<br />
Unfortunately, there is no fruit you can
harvest.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Your spirit is like the lonely moon in the sky” suggests that you would rather stand alone than go along with something which you do not feel is right. Some things will work out, but not all the time. There is no point in complaining when luck is not with you.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Like green pine tree and cedar you stand gracefully,” suggests that you have the determination to succeed. “More than enough land for growing crops, plant some mulberry and other trees,” means you are prosperous. Mulberry trees were only planted on spare land, after enough crops were planted for food.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Dawn of a good era, every Rooster year,” implies that you enjoy fortunate times every Rooster year. You also enjoy good luck in your later years (“from the right direction wind does blow”). To reach “the top of the forest” means you reach the top of your profession.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    When a relationship breaks up (“mandarin ducks fly apart”), there are other romantic opportunities. You might as well make the most of the interest from admirers and enjoy yourself (“under bright moon and cool breeze”).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Doing charitable deeds generates good karma, which helps your children (“fruits”) overcome difficulties (“wind is strong and rain is heavy”). To be like “dragon and phoenix flying to heaven” means your children will succeed. For followers, you can attract successful followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can settle in pleasant surroundings. “Fisherman rows boat through fairyland of peach trees” implies that you spend your last days in a wonderful setting.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “This life is born without luck,” suggests that you did not start your life in fortunate circumstances (“wind is hitting the lotus flowers”).  “In the Li palace fire is so strong wood is burned to charcoal,” means beware of burning yourself out in your prime. “In Dui palace metal grows and takes root” implies that luck will be with you in your later years. “You worry about the red petals flying in the wind” alludes to the red lotus and the possibility of a relationship breaking apart. “Unfortunately, there is no fruit you can harvest” indicates that it would be difficult for you to save a troubled romance.
