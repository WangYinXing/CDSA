<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>When this life is examined in detail, it
looks like someone performing on top of a pole, there is no stable footing. It
is also like building a house by the sea, even with a pillar it will not be
safe. Whether you are going forward or backward there will be a lot of
uncertainty.&nbsp; Relatives cannot give you a
helping hand. Siblings will become your enemies, so it is suitable to start all
over again outside. Never depend on your family business.&nbsp; Everybody from afar respects you.&nbsp; Those who are close to you, treat you as if
you are of no importance. Even when you are successful do not show off too much,
otherwise people be laughing at you. If you leave your hometown, to your surprise
there will be honorable people to help you.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Gold and treasure grow automatically.<br />
By middle age a lot of things waiting for
you.<br />
Ambition to establish something? Follow
through.<br />
Then, mulberry trees grow fully, clouds make
way for the moon.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
A lot of changes to your doors because you have to travel,<br />
You have to go to the water concourse to
meet people.<br />
Someone who appreciates your song, with
musical instrument plays along.<br />
About drinking alone, never worry, plenty
of company.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
In the sand dunes mandarin ducks and
water fowls gather.<br />
Before flying
to the five lakes, they group together.&nbsp;<br />
Row your
boat through weeds, to middle of the lake steer.<br />
Drop the
net to catch fish under the bright moon in autumn.<br />
To find
the right one requires a lot of determination.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
After the flowers have withered,<br />
One fruit on the branch means one son.<br />
Because of many good deeds you&#8217;ve done,<br />
Your only son gives you grandchildren.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Do not travel along the risky pathway,
risky roads.<br />
On
horseback or in a boat, shocking events are close.<br />
If you
come across danger, there&#8217;s fortune that follows.<br />
Because of
the fortunate star being present,<br />
Come
back to life in a deadly situation.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Planting a Pine Tree on the Rocks<br />
</strong>The pine tree branches reach up in the sky
because of the firm character.<br />
You can stand the cold weather naturally.<br />
Your great talent will be appreciated
eventually.<br />
Floating in the waves you have to let
others go first.<br />
There are four or five flowers blossoming
in autumn.<br />
There are two or three rows of flying geese
at sunset.<br />
If you can foretell success and failure in
your life then build your boat and travel to a beautiful land.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Since your family background is unlikely to be beneficial to you, it would be a good idea to leave your hometown. You can find success and enjoy life more when you go elsewhere.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can go for your goals and succeed eventually. “Mulberry trees grow fully, clouds make way for the moon” implies that you will prosper and problems will disappear.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “A lot of changes to your doors because you have to travel,” means you change residences many times due to travelling around. To “go to the water concourse to meet people” can be taken literally, or it could imply that you go to a busy place. You can work together with someone who appreciates you (“appreciates your song, with musical instrument plays along”).
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    Even though there are eligible singles around, you need make some effort when it comes to love and marriage (“row your boat through weeds”). “Drop the net to catch fish under bright moon in autumn” alludes to you finding the right partner in your middle-aged (autumn) years.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    One son is predicted, and there will be grandchildren because you generated good karma with charitable acts.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Be careful when it comes to taking risks. Your luck is such that you can recover from dangerous situations.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are determined and ambitious (like the pine tree), with the ability to withstand adversity (cold weather). “Floating in the waves you have to let others go first” suggests that you need to be patient and wait until the time is right. You have success in your later years (“flowers blossoming in autumn”) and life becomes more organised (like geese flying in formation). If you know what is good for you, be prepared to travel.
