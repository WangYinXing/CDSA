<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This is a person who is understanding and
open-minded. Your attitude towards doing things involves taking care of the all
the details. When you are patient you are like a sleeping Buddha. When you are
impatient you are like fighting Buddha holding up fists. Within your character
there is both rigidity and flexibility, yet you will not kneel down to flatter
others.&nbsp; Gossip is like a rope that binds
your feet together. Fame and fortune can imprison your being.&nbsp; Between you and your children there is much
room for improvement when it comes to understanding each other. The relationship
you have with your relatives has gone sour. In the morning you need to think and
in the evening you need to calculate, so you only sleep for a few hours each
night. Even though you try all means, only one out of three decades turns out
to be fortunate. Having tasted all the harsh wind and bitter frost early in
life, you can then enjoy the leisurely life.</p>
<p><strong>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Young swallows, when wings fully grown, leave the nest,<br />
To go to grand mansion with carved pillars,
the best.<br />
Riding the wind and dancing to heaven,<br />
Lead the way across distant horizon,<br />
On a lengthy journey of miles ten thousand.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
In Ox year set off on the road to succeed.<br />
In Rat year, benevolent boss you will meet.<br />
Under his care, you will establish a great
career.<br />
Hold a bow and arrow to chase after the
deer.<br />
The deer is your goal, but everything is
virtual.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Lonely in spring, outside window full moon shines through.<br />
Want to play a joyful melody, yet you are
playing the blues.<br />
Away to a distant marsh, mandarin ducks
flying.<br />
Watch other water fowls in the pond
playing.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
In wind and rain, peach blossom petals
falling.<br />
Did not imagine
some of them would be going.<br />
Who
believes, in back garden, flowers again blooming,<br />
On a
branch, one wonderful fruit hanging.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
To look at gold and pearls around you is not satisfying.<br />
Needless to mention it depends on luck and good
timing.<br />
Bell chimes, water clock has dripped to
dawn, no dreaming.<br />
Cuckoo is telling you that the evening
clouds are arriving.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Beautiful Moon on an Autumn Night<br />
</strong>Moonbeam shines over a thousand miles, cool
and clear.<br />
Lonely goose calls in the middle of night
to seek companion.<br />
Parents are gone like clouds leaving you
behind.<br />
Siblings are like rivers flowing to the
east without return.<br />
You live a happy and stable life in later
years.<br />
In the beginning you have to run about and
the achievement was not satisfactory.<br />
Don&#8217;t laugh at the beautiful scenery of
spring.<br />
Listen to the nightingale under the peony. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Although life often seems complicated, you can choose not to think too much about things. “Having tasted all the harsh wind and bitter frost early in life,” means you deal with difficulties when you are young. Your luck improves later on in life.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You leave home as soon as you are ready to be independent. After a long journey (“journey of miles ten thousand”) you reach a good destination (“grand mansion with carved pillars”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Hold a bow and arrow to chase after the deer” implies that you are dedicated to pursuing your goals.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    Love and marriage will not happen when you are young (“lonely in spring”). “Away to distant marsh, mandarin ducks flying” suggests that you will find a match later in life.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Even though you face difficulties (“wind and rain”), at first, there will be children (“flowers blooming”). One of your children will be amazing (“one wonderful fruit hanging”). For followers, there is one who is outstanding.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    There is more to life than material wealth (“To look at gold and pearls around you is not satisfying”). You prosper when you have good luck. Towards the end of your days you reflect on what you have been through, and gain insights on the ups and downs in your life.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    It’s important for you to find a spouse. Do not expect to rely on your relatives. “Don’t laugh at the beautiful scenery of spring. Listen to the nightingale under the peony,” suggests that you make the most of your youth.
