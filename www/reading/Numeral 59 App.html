<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This is a person who thinks a lot and
worries a lot. In this life it is easy to fail and easy to succeed.&nbsp; Although it is difficult to have great
accomplishment, there are lots of small successes. You know when to advance and
when to retreat, and you know what is high and what is low. It can be difficult
to make up your mind as you are a person who stands on firm ground. There is
impatience over small matters, yet you can be relaxed over big things. Your
sentiments are unpredictable. There will not be a fight over big money because
instead of taking care of the dollars, you take care of the cents. It can feel
like no matter how much you do for others, they will not be satisfied. When you
rescue someone, they might not show their gratitude. There is misfortune hiding
under fortune. Whatever is unfortunate will become fortunate in the end. Even
though the Retreating Spirit affects your life, there is no danger of lawsuit and
imprisonment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
When on top of the pole, you&#8217;re a
performer,<br />
Right in
front of you there is danger.<br />
There
will be a girl to guide you to the leader.<br />
At
night, at the water concourse get help from a stranger.<br />
Send
many thanks to heaven after you prosper.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Gold and jade are not what is most precious.<br />
Accumulation of good deeds is a true
purpose,<br />
Also, with good people, keep some closeness.<br />
In this world, a lack of love is
lamentable,<br />
Friendships as thin as paper, not
dependable.<br />
When you look back repeatedly,<br />
What appears illusory becomes reality.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
In the pond mandarin ducks swim playfully,<br />
Two or three couples keep the green lotus
company.<br />
Love and romance won&#8217;t come at the best of
times, hardly.<br />
At thirty-six, the moon will be full again
then you marry.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
By end
of spring, no fruit on plum tree, as it were.<br />
Look for
the flower by the side of the water.<br />
In later
life, feel lonely on the river.<br />
When
hair has turned grey get successors.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Ox year is not the time to get on board with a new project or trip.<br />
In Rat years don&#8217;t even think of riding a
horse or boarding a ship.<br />
When you see danger and there&#8217;s no danger,
there&#8217;s fortune eventually.<br />
You come back to sing a song amongst the
flowers of prosperity.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Mandarin Ducks Playing in the Water<br />
</strong>Mandarin ducks play in lotus pond.<br />
You will not be able to meet the one
wearing red until after middle age.<br />
If the money is there, you have to keep
your hand in.<br />
Even when you have grey hair you have to
hold onto power.<br />
Like wild geese flying in pairs to a
distant land.<br />
Mandarin ducks flirt by the pond-side.<br />
If you still want to ask about your life, you
will live a long life like the pine tree in your garden.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Unfortunate situations will turn out to be fortunate in the end. “Retreating Spirit” refers to setbacks, but these will not be serious.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “When on top of the pole, you’re a performer, right in front of you there is danger” implies that you might need to take risks in your work. “At night, at the water concourse get help from a stranger,” suggests that someone will help you, discreetly, when you are at a crossroads.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    The purpose of life is about improving the quality of your soul (accumulation of good deeds) and rather than acquiring wealth (gold and jade). Value your true friends. What you imagine can turn out to be true (“what appears illusory becomes reality”).
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Two or three couples keep the green lotus company” suggests that you go through a few courtships. It is predicted that you marry at age thirty-six.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “By end of spring, no fruit on plum tree” suggests that children will not come when you are young. Children come along late in life. For followers, they will turn up eventually.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    In Ox years and Rat years avoid taking chances. If you are cautious and take calculated risks you will succeed eventually. To “come back to sing a song amongst the flowers of prosperity” suggests your achievements will be noticed.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You will meet an influential person (“one wearing red”) later in life. The references to mandarin ducks and wild geese suggest several relationships. A long life is predicted.
