<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This star indicates you are a person who is
virtuous. Therefore, you can get close to noble people. Since your character is
straightforward and your heart is kind, there is no way you would compromise
with dishonorable people to agree to do something unethical.&nbsp; Giving flattery to others is something you do
not believe in. &nbsp;You are very firm in the
five virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom and trust.&nbsp; Your Four Pillars chart is peaceful and
harmonious.&nbsp; Picture a crane on a pine
tree and the moon shining over a cool and calm pond, if you do good deeds you will
live very long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses<br />
</strong>Foundation:<br />
On the
lone pine tree, the crane is there calling.<br />
You&#8217;ve
great ambitions to reach the purple clouds flying.<br />
White
jade and yellow gold are not worthy treasures,<br />
Writing
with great skill and wisdom are finer pleasures.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Jade cloth, gold and pearls all before your eyes to see.<br />
Red door and green windows not as it should
be,<br />
Occupant of opulent house is carefree like
a fairy.<br />
Change the d&#233;cor of your house to suit your
needs.<br />
In gratitude to heaven, accumulate good
deeds.<br />
When wealthy, give to charity rather than enjoy
luxury.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
White clouds, right by your window sill, floating.<br />
Husband and wife are quietly whispering,<br />
Like a pair of swallows in distant
mountain.<br />
Enjoy a quiet married life, as time goes by
feel lonely.<br />
In the back garden lots of butterflies and
bees,<br />
Means many visitors come to keep you
company.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
For good musical instruments spend a lot of money.<br />
Throughout the
years willow twigs and peach roots keep you company.<br />
Give your children
a good education.<br />
For that will
build a strong foundation.<br />
Outside they build
careers that are amazing,<br />
In late years pine
trees and cinnamon will be flourishing.<br />
Bring back a lot
of grandchildren is the meaning.</p>
<p><br />
Harvest:<br />
Difficulties in Dragon and Dog years lots of wind and rain.<br />
There is the bridge for the fairy, what does
it really mean?<br />
West mountain has bitter wind and unkind
rain.<br />
Hear the crane calling and the baboons
screaming.<br />
Take it easy and imagine it is the shepherd
that is singing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Reform and Revolutionary Style<br />
</strong>Deserting what is old and following what is
new will bring you prosperity.<br />
Fame and fortune will come in force.<br />
Wild goose is flying over clouds to a faraway
land.<br />
Petals flying over stream making the water
red.<br />
Whatever happens in this world is always
meaningful.<br />
Whatever you can save take it easy.<br />
At Dragon&#8217;s head and Tiger&#8217;s tail great
tidings will arrive.<br />
You will decorate your house to welcome the
fortune.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Your Four Pillars chart is peaceful and harmonious” implies that you were born with a calm nature. The crane is a symbol of longevity and good fortune. If you create good karma with charitable acts you can enjoy a long and happy life.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “On lone pine tree, the crane is there calling” suggests that you have a lot of determination.  You are ambitious yet you are not  interested in gaining wealth, instead you seek knowledge.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    In ancient China, only the very wealthy could afford to paint their houses with “red door and green windows”. A lavish lifestyle does not suit your carefree nature therefore you “change the décor of your house to suit your needs”.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    As a couple, you enjoy a quiet domestic set-up. When you feel lonely, invite friends round for company.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “For good musical instruments spend a lot of money” refers to spending on your children’s education and not just on equipment. For followers, you train them well and they will be successful.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Be cautious during Dragon and Dog years. If you feel troubled or have a lot on your mind it is important to relax (“Take it easy and imagine it is the shepherd that is singing”).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Wild goose is flying over the clouds to a faraway land,” suggests that you make a long journey. “Petals flying over stream making the water red,” means that the red petals fall into the water, and implies that some things do not last. At start of the Dragon year (Dragon’s head) or end of Tiger year (Tiger’s tail) you will hear good news.
