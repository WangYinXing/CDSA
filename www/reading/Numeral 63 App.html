<p><strong>Destiny<br />
</strong>This star indicates you are a person who is
virtuous. Therefore, you can get close to noble people. Since your character is
straightforward and your heart is kind, there is no way you would compromise
with dishonorable people to agree to do something unethical.&nbsp; Giving flattery to others is something you do
not believe in. &nbsp;You are very firm in the
five virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom and trust.&nbsp; Your Four Pillars chart is peaceful and
harmonious.&nbsp; Picture a crane on a pine
tree and the moon shining over a cool and calm pond, if you do good deeds you will
live very long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

On the
lone pine tree, the crane is there calling.<br />
You&#8217;ve
great ambitions to reach the purple clouds flying.<br />

When wealthy, give to charity rather than enjoy
luxury.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
White clouds, right by your window sill, floating.<br />
Husband and wife are quietly whispering,<br />
Like a pair of swallows in distant
mountain.<br />
Enjoy a quiet married life, as time goes by
feel lonely.<br />
In the back garden lots of butterflies and
bees,<br />

company.</p>

For good musical instruments spend a lot of money.<br />
Throughout the
years willow twigs and peach roots keep you company.<br />

Outside they build
careers that are amazing,<br />
In late years pine
trees and cinnamon will be flourishing.<br />
Bring back a lot
of grandchildren is the meaning.</p>
<p><br />
Harvest:<br />
Difficulties in Dragon and Dog years lots of wind and rain.<br />
There is the bridge for the fairy, what does
it really mean?<br />
West mountain has bitter wind and unkind
rain.<br />
Hear the crane calling and the baboons
screaming.<br />
Take it easy and imagine it is the shepherd
that is singing.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Reform and Revolutionary Style<br />
</strong>Deserting what is old and following what is
new will bring you prosperity.<br />
Fame and fortune will come in force.<br />
Wild goose is flying over clouds to a faraway
land.<br />
Petals flying over stream making the water
red.<br />
Whatever happens in this world is always
meaningful.<br />
Whatever you can save take it easy.<br />
At Dragon&#8217;s head and Tiger&#8217;s tail great
tidings will arrive.<br />
You will decorate your house to welcome the
fortune.</p>
