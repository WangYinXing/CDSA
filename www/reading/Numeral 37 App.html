<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>You can easily form good relationships in
the beginning. However, you can easily fall out with friends and become foes in
the end. By thinking of new techniques, you want to make what you do most
proficient, but it turns out not to be the right way. You are frank with people
and speak from the bottom of your heart, but eventually these people betray
you. It is hard for you to establish good human relationships. The connection
with siblings is not peaceful. Leave your hometown to start a new life outside.
Live in solitude. When life looks promising, it turns out to be not so, your
fortune is like clouds covering the bright autumn moon. Wealth is like petals
being blown about in the spring wind, what is blooming can be easily scattered.
Even though you have friends and relatives, it is as if you have none. You have
to shoulder all the responsibilities yourself. Think about it carefully, who
can work in partnership with you.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Time decrees decay, time decrees glory.<br />
With hard work comes strong opportunity.<br />
In the end you&#8217;ll have power, victory,<br />
With helping hands you rely on fully.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
The path is very crooked and dangerous.~<br />
Whip horse,
speed up to reach destination.~<br />
When you
get help, success is right ahead.<br />
Laugh
proudly at your special achievement.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
In lotus pond, two mandarin ducks play,<br />
Other water fowl don&#8217;t disturb you anyway.<br />
Arriving at north side of the mountain,<br />
Here, it is very quiet for certain.<br />
In old age wind and frost your companions.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Flowers bloom, flowers wither, don&#8217;t
despair.<br />
In the end a
filial one will be there.<br />
Five leaves are sons, three flowers are
daughters,<br />
One is outstanding, extremely clever.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
When Tiger meets Goat it is time to
go.<br />
Whatever
is going on, you already know.<br />
Recalling
all those beautiful days past,<br />
Such
great times, many good memories last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Spending Time Alone Upstairs<br />
</strong>Every day
at sunset on the beautifully decorated terrace, you look out to the horizon and
the sea.<br />
The
lonely boat does not bring you any tidings from home.<br />
You have
travelled far over the waves.<br />
Eventually
you made it to your destination.<br />
Trust
your fate that there is opportunity for you to earn enough to raise your
family.<br />
If you
ask the grey haired fisherman, he&#8217;ll tell you to follow the path on the
waterways made by the bulrushes to reach paradise.</p>
