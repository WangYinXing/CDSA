<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is fortunate, blessed by a
fortunate star that brings many happy events. You want a peaceful life, yet you
have many worries.&nbsp; In your most
embarrassing and uncomfortable moments, you are rescued by a lucky star. You
think your ideas are amazing, but they turn out to be nothing spectacular and
are rather ordinary. When you think you are doing the right thing, the outcome
is wrong. Your relatives treat you as a stranger, outsiders understand you a
lot better.&nbsp; There is a mismatch with
your spouse. The pair of you are like chalk and cheese, you do not share much
in common. Being an unhappy couple affects the children. There are a lot of
arguments with your siblings with nothing accomplished, like clattering an iron
broom against a copper bowl. Yet in the end the harvest is good.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Great goals to catch the celebrated
turtle,<br />
Difficult
to go fish in stormy high seas,<br />
Nevertheless
you overcome many troubles.<br />
Lush
plum blossoms and sturdy maple trees,<br />
Remind
you of home sweet home, comfort in dreams.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Seeking big goals, ambitions are high.<br />
A golden
horse, you shall ride,<br />
To meet influential
people in the jade hall,<br />
Your
good name in famous places, leaves them enthralled.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
A single wild goose flies towards a great big tree,<br />
To welcome him, a crane sings notes
beautifully.<br />
On the branches of a maple tree they stay,
resting firmly.<br />
Seagulls and herons flock around, happy
times in good company.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
At sunset the cicada sings on the branch of
the willow.<br />
Red evening clouds fly across blue skies,<br />
Herons bathing in the pond below.<br />
On the apple tree, blossoms are red and
white,<br />
Evening breeze caresses the dream into the
night.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
You stop the horse and look back on a spring
scene so charming,<br />
On a
high mountain you shoot three arrows, carefully aiming,<br />
Thought
you had shot a bird, yet all birds are laughing.<br />
When the
clouds blow away, you finish daydreaming.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Phoenix Sleeping in the Maple Tree<br />
</strong>Like a phoenix fishing for intelligent turtles,<br />
You sail along bravely in high seas and
high waves.<br />
Wild goose flies over clear sky, seagulls
making their journey of migration.<br />
Rain falls so hard the branches of the tree
are damaged,<br />
The fruits are in danger of falling off.<br />
If your hometown is in the north, you head
south, to settle down elsewhere.<br />
In springtime you will meet helpful people.<br />
Year of the Dog brings you success.<br />
In Ox and Horse years you will have good motivation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Even though you can enjoy good luck, not everything in your life is perfect. You might have differences with your spouse and disagreements with your siblings. It all turns out well in the end.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can achieve your goals even though you face some difficulties. You will miss home, which suggests that you moved away.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are highly ambitious and can gain a good reputation. You can climb the greasy pole to meet the top people.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You and your spouse are from different backgrounds and may have some misunderstandings to begin with. You can enjoy a good social life with lots of friends.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Children can bring happiness. They will fly the nest. Followers will come and go.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    When you look back you can reminisce about good times. You might not get everything you dreamed about. Not all your high ambitions will be met (you aim, but you do not hit your target).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are willing to face challenges in order to seek a worthwhile aim. You can soar to great heights, whilst others are being quite ordinary. The circumstances you face can sometimes be risky. You are likely to move away from your hometown. “In springtime you will meet helpful people” can refer to your youth, or the time of year.
