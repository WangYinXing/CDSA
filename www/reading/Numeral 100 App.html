<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is like pine trees growing on the
mountainside and like the bamboo growing tall. The root and the stem are
precious, making your character very ethical, firm and determined. Born with a
kind heart, your nature is to help under-privileged people and you enjoy
helping people fight against injustice. Parents are like your honorable guests,
they won&#8217;t bother to control your life. Siblings are like the moon behind the
clouds, they are bright but they are not shining all the time.The people who are close to you are like the
geese flying away. However, husband and wife are always together in the same
nest. When you go home there is nothing to worry about. Children are not close
to you, three keep a distance and two turn their backs. Don&#8217;t complain about the
bickering in your life, after the storm you will sail in a peaceful sea.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Born into a famous family, you can compete.<br />
From a wealthy background, you&#8217;re in the
elite.<br />
Work hard and pass examinations.<br />
Then the future is like sea and sky, immeasurable.<br />
At age forty-five you&#8217;re prosperous and
successful.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
The first half of your life you have gone through a lot,<br />
Happily encountering fame and fortune was
the upshot.<br />
Gold is refined and jade is polished, well
known and affluent.<br />
In late years, you should be most grateful
and give thanks to heaven.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Whilst the sun is bright, thick clouds bring unexpected shower.<br />
After a thousand miles, bright moon you
will encounter.<br />
In a distant land, again you come together.<br />
Nobody disturbs you when closing the door
to your chamber.<br />
Protected from disturbance outside the
window, there&#8217;s no bother.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
When flowers bloom wind and rain come.<br />
Two branches are good in the back garden.<br />
Orchids and mulberry are very lovely.<br />
Enjoy a wonderful life under the sky.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In those days you had great ambition.<br />
Kun fish to big Peng bird transformation,<br />
Over nine states big Peng is flying.<br />
Rooster and Dog years you&#8217;re laughing,<br />
To east mountain where the fairies staying,<br />
There a great time you&#8217;ll be enjoying.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Pine Trees Deep in the Mountains<br />
</strong>Whilst you are young, you are hard-working.<br />
Then you know fame and fortune come
together.<br />
As long as the roots are unbroken, the
grass at the front of your house will grow.<br />
But you need to plant the plum tree on the
mountain with seeds.<br />
When the flowers wither away, don&#8217;t
complain because a fruit will come early.<br />
When the plum is blossoming, don&#8217;t complain
about the moon coming late.<br />
When is it a good time in life?<br />
Just wait for the dragon and tiger to roar.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You believe in doing the right thing, so follow your heart. There is no need to look to your relatives for approval. Life will be calm in the end.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    There are a lot of opportunities (“future is like sea and sky, immeasurable”), if you gain qualifications.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can enjoy success later in life, having dealt with challenges earlier.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    There is disruption to a good relationship (“sun is bright, thick clouds bring unexpected shower”). After being apart, you get back together (“after a thousand miles, bright moon you will encounter”). You enjoy an intimate relationship as a couple.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    There might be some difficulties (“wind and rain”) when it comes to having children, yet it turns out well and they arrive. “Orchid and mulberry are very lovely,” suggests that your children are attractive and pleasant.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    When the mythological creature, Kun as a fish, turns into big bird Peng, it symbolizes someone who is able to adapt and go far as a result. “Over the nine states big Peng is flying,” means you cover the whole country. “To east mountain where the fairies are staying,” suggests that you go to a wonderful place where you enjoy yourself.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    It is easy for you to flourish close to home (“as long as the roots are unbroken, the grass at the front of your house will grow”). If you have bigger ambitions you need to start from scratch, without any prior advantage (“But you need to plant the plum tree on the mountain with seeds”). “When the flowers wither away, don’t complain because a fruit will come early. When the plum is blossoming, don’t complain about the moon coming late,” means that even if it is not what you expect, events will turn out well. “Just wait for the dragon and tiger to roar” implies that you will have a good time throughout your life, because they roar regularly.
