<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This life is like pine trees growing on the
mountainside and like the bamboo growing tall. The root and the stem are
precious, making your character very ethical, firm and determined. Born with a
kind heart, your nature is to help under-privileged people and you enjoy
helping people fight against injustice. Parents are like your honorable guests,
they won&#8217;t bother to control your life. Siblings are like the moon behind the
clouds, they are bright but they are not shining all the time.The people who are close to you are like the
geese flying away. However, husband and wife are always together in the same
nest. When you go home there is nothing to worry about. Children are not close
to you, three keep a distance and two turn their backs. Don&#8217;t complain about the
bickering in your life, after the storm you will sail in a peaceful sea.</p>

<p>Life Path:<br />
The first half of your life you have gone through a lot,<br />
Happily encountering fame and fortune was
the upshot.<br />

known and affluent.<br />
In late years, you should be most grateful
and give thanks to heaven.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Whilst the sun is bright, thick clouds bring unexpected shower.<br />
After a thousand miles, bright moon you
will encounter.<br />
In a distant land, again you come together.<br />
Nobody disturbs you when closing the door
to your chamber.<br />
Protected from disturbance outside the
window, there&#8217;s no bother.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
When flowers bloom wind and rain come.<br />

<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Pine Trees Deep in the Mountains<br />
</strong>Whilst you are young, you are hard-working.<br />
Then you know fame and fortune come
together.<br />
As long as the roots are unbroken, the
grass at the front of your house will grow.<br />
But you need to plant the plum tree on the
mountain with seeds.<br />
When the flowers wither away, don&#8217;t
complain because a fruit will come early.<br />
When the plum is blossoming, don&#8217;t complain
about the moon coming late.<br />
When is it a good time in life?<br />
Just wait for the dragon and tiger to roar.</p>
