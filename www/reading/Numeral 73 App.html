<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is like fording a river in strong
gusts of wind. When you go across the sea and go through the mountains, there
will be three rises and three falls in your life. You start your career quite
early to bring wealth to your family.&nbsp; Life
will be very busy, so that you get children quite late. All this is
pre-determined by your fate.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Tree has
withered for many years, now gives birth to new blossoms wonderful.<br />
Like a
sick tiger that&#8217;s recovered, showing off paws and teeth that are powerful.<br />
When one
day wind and clouds are meeting,<br />
Dragon
and Tiger join forces to make a living.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
It is all because of your ancestor&#8217;s great name,<br />
You can dress up to establish power again.<br />
If you let everything go easy,<br />
And do a lot of work for charity,<br />
Good days will be back for you to see.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Purple swallow rests in a safe place, means spouse in your house,<br />
Flying through the screen and staying
behind the curtain.<br />
When the swallow flies away, it means
separation.<br />
East wind comes again, you hear the crows,<br />
Watch people outside, but home alone, solo.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
One flower, one fruit outside the wall.<br />
Who knows when the
fruit ripens, it bears a good name.<br />
Son carries a great and good reputation,<br />
Because of charitable work you&#8217;ve done.<br />
Even the emperor has heard of your charity
fame.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Snake and Dog years are lucky ones.<br />
Birch forest is facing the setting sun.<br />
On the high mountain, water is flowing,<br />
But where is the person? The person?<br />
Only a good name is left in heaven.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Cloud Covering the Moon<br />
</strong>When the moon is over the mid-sky shadow
will be moving automatically.<br />
There is a time for clouds to come, a time
for clouds to disperse.<br />
When the wind is cold, goose coming from
afar has lost its companion.<br />
Even the pine tree has shed its needles in
the cold dew, but the crane doesn&#8217;t know this.<br />
Even though the path created by the
ancestors is very stable you still have to part from it.<br />
Love from your parents is thick and heavy,
but you need to separate from them, leave home.<br />
Let us ask how much light in spring can
reach you? The answer is a wonderful one.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “This life is like fording a river in strong gusts of wind,” implies that you can make progress under harsh circumstances. “When you go across the sea and go through the mountains, there will be three rises and three falls in your life,” suggests that you can overcome challenges on many occasions.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    An old business can go through a revival, and it can be profitable when the time is right (“Dragon and Tiger join forces to make a living”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    Your family reputation is such that you can use it to gain status or authority. Doing good deeds creates good karma, which helps you succeed.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are likely to marry and settle down, yet it might not last. There are other romantic opportunities (“east wind comes again”), so you need to go out instead of staying at home by yourself.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    A daughter (flower) and a son (fruit) are predicted. Your son gains a good social status because you created good karma with well-known charitable deeds (“even the emperor has heard of your charity fame”). For followers, your legacy will live on with your followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    The birch tree tends to sprout new leaves before other trees in spring. Birch trees are symbolic of renewal and new life. “Birch forest is facing the setting sun,” suggests that even at the end of your life (“setting sun”) your reputation lives on, and that you leave a lasting legacy (“On the high mountain, water is flowing”).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    As time progresses (“moon is over the mid-sky the shadow will be moving,”), luck comes and goes (“a time for clouds to come, a time for clouds to disperse”). “When the wind is cold, goose coming from afar has lost its companion,” suggests you will separate from your spouse. “Even the pine tree has shed its needles in the cold dew, but the crane doesn’t know this,” means you have a lot of determination. “Let us ask how much light in spring can reach you,” means how successful will you be? “The answer is a wonderful one” implies that you get good results.
