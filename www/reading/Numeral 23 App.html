<p><strong>Destiny<br />
</strong>This life is ruled by a star that can give
you a high official position and lead to you gaining recognition.&nbsp; You are glorified by the post that you hold,
yet your luck comes late. You know how to succeed and can manage by yourself,
so you don&#8217;t care about flattering your superiors.&nbsp; Human relationships are not your strength, so
even when something good is coming, it is going to meet a lot of barriers. Friends
become enemies. Close friends become strangers. There are three areas of your
life where you need to be cautious regarding expectations: recognition, assets
and children. You work hard from when you are young. Wherever and whenever you
climb to the top, be prepared for the return journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
One
brings you wealth and one dispels evil,<br />
A pair
of Pi Yao, the fortunate animals,<br />
Help you
gain an extraordinary reputation.<br />
Supporters
from afar give you good recommendations.<br />
So you
fly with laughter, whilst waiting for the jade pendant.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Taking a bow and arrow is not your style,<br />
Not really, still you end up in the
military,<br />
At dawn you hear a sound. If you ask,<br />
The lord will point to a wide path in
front.<br />
You carry the flag behind a general, most
gallant,<br />
Mission accomplished, returning in victory.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Lots of romantic prospects around,<br />
Yet for you attraction not found.<br />
When the mandarin ducks part,<br />
Find another to share your heart.<br />
Many children come late.<br />
Bamboo and plum blossoms await.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
At last, two daughters, two sons, turn up late,<br />
Give you much
cause to celebrate.<br />
Your son can be crowned in laurels, with
orchids around,<br />
If born in Ox and Tiger year, achievement
with no bounds.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
If you set sail in Tiger year, give it a second thought,<br />
There could be danger, when you go ashore.<br />
In Dragon year you know what to do,
opportunities are here,<br />
Pull up the sail and go ahead, nothing to
fear.</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Tiger in a Trap in Pine Forest<br />
</strong>Your life is like growing willow trees; some
flourish, some don&#8217;t.<br />
Wild geese fly overhead, but are stopped by
the clouds.<br />
Chrysanthemums bloom by the dry roadside, so
you will have enjoyment in your late years.<br />
The mountain is so cold that the trapped
tiger eventually wakes up.<br />
When the flowers bloom, because the ground
is cold, the seeds are damaged.&nbsp;<br />
Once you have the inspiration to go abroad,
follow through, for one day you will come back to your hometown in full
splendor.</p>
