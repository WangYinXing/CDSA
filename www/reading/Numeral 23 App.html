<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is ruled by a star that can give
you a high official position and lead to you gaining recognition.&nbsp; You are glorified by the post that you hold,
yet your luck comes late. You know how to succeed and can manage by yourself,
so you don&#8217;t care about flattering your superiors.&nbsp; Human relationships are not your strength, so
even when something good is coming, it is going to meet a lot of barriers. Friends
become enemies. Close friends become strangers. There are three areas of your
life where you need to be cautious regarding expectations: recognition, assets
and children. You work hard from when you are young. Wherever and whenever you
climb to the top, be prepared for the return journey.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
One
brings you wealth and one dispels evil,<br />
A pair
of Pi Yao, the fortunate animals,<br />
Help you
gain an extraordinary reputation.<br />
Supporters
from afar give you good recommendations.<br />
So you
fly with laughter, whilst waiting for the jade pendant.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Taking a bow and arrow is not your style,<br />
Not really, still you end up in the
military,<br />
At dawn you hear a sound. If you ask,<br />
The lord will point to a wide path in
front.<br />
You carry the flag behind a general, most
gallant,<br />
Mission accomplished, returning in victory.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Lots of romantic prospects around,<br />
Yet for you attraction not found.<br />
When the mandarin ducks part,<br />
Find another to share your heart.<br />
Many children come late.<br />
Bamboo and plum blossoms await.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
At last, two daughters, two sons, turn up late,<br />
Give you much
cause to celebrate.<br />
Your son can be crowned in laurels, with
orchids around,<br />
If born in Ox and Tiger year, achievement
with no bounds.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
If you set sail in Tiger year, give it a second thought,<br />
There could be danger, when you go ashore.<br />
In Dragon year you know what to do,
opportunities are here,<br />
Pull up the sail and go ahead, nothing to
fear.</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Tiger in a Trap in Pine Forest<br />
</strong>Your life is like growing willow trees; some
flourish, some don&#8217;t.<br />
Wild geese fly overhead, but are stopped by
the clouds.<br />
Chrysanthemums bloom by the dry roadside, so
you will have enjoyment in your late years.<br />
The mountain is so cold that the trapped
tiger eventually wakes up.<br />
When the flowers bloom, because the ground
is cold, the seeds are damaged.&nbsp;<br />
Once you have the inspiration to go abroad,
follow through, for one day you will come back to your hometown in full
splendor.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are diligent and can gain authority. Developing your social skills will help you achieve your goals more smoothly.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    Pi Yao refers to a pair of Chinese mythical creatures, often found as ornaments. One of the pair acts as a protector (“dispels evil”), whilst the other brings wealth. You can be lucky enough to gain wealth and feel safe. “So you fly with laughter, whilst waiting for the jade pendant” means you can make good progress and look forward to receiving praise and awards.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Taking a bow and arrow is not your style, not really still you end up in the military” implies that you end up in a large organisation, even though you do not think of yourself as being the sort of person who likes to serve as part of an organisation. You can have achievement by following a successful leader.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    If you experience a break-up (“mandarin ducks part”) you will have other chances to find the right relationship. “Bamboo and plum blossoms await” suggests that it will work out alright in the end.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Eventually, you can have two daughters and two sons. A son born in an Ox year or Tiger year can be a high-achiever (“crowned in laurels, with orchids around”). For followers, it suggests that you will have a very successful male follower.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “If you set sail in Tiger year, give it a second thought” implies there is a need to be cautious during Tiger years. In contrast, Dragon years are lucky.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    Not all your endeavours will turn out to be successful (“like growing willow trees; some flourish, some don’t”), yet you can prosper after middle age (“chrysanthemums bloom by the dry roadside, enjoyment in your later years”). When you find yourself in difficult situation, you will find a way out (“The mountain is so cold that the trapped tiger eventually wakes up”). When you are successful (“when flowers bloom”), you can face setbacks with what you attempt next (“because the ground is cold, the seeds are damaged,”).
