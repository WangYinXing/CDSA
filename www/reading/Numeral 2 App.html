<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong><span style="letter-spacing: 0pt; word-spacing: 0pt;">You are bold and courageous, yet you are
carefree. Your weakness is that you do not think ahead and plan carefully and
you are not persistent. If someone laughs at you once, you will change your
mind and alter your plans. Neither good luck nor bad luck will last. In your
early years you are strong and mobile, yet you feel disappointed and
discouraged in middle age. There are lots of unexpected difficulties in life.
Even though you may have a family, you have to spend time away from your spouse
and children. Friends are good company for entertainment only. They do not make
suitable business partners. To live the life of a monk or a nun is a good
solution.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
The green willow tree surrounds the
city.<br />
The
blossoms are so light, as light as a feather.<br />
Yet,
strong winds cannot disperse them all,<br />
Despite
hardship, the family is still together</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
During
Tiger tail and Rabbit head, money will be made.<br />
Ox and Goat
will gain you a good name.<br />
Though risky under the mulberry tree shade,<br />
You will
not lose the way, finding acclaim.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
The
mandarin ducks are tired, so weary,<br />
Struggling
in the rain, so dreary.<br />
Though
the time is the spring season,<br />
There is
a lack of a good companion.<br />
Better to rest a while in lotus pond,<br />
And
watch the scared birds be gone.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
The peach blossoms are ever so
beautiful.<br />
Two
fruits are before the horse&#8217;s head.<br />
Elegant clothes they&#8217;ll wear in the
capital.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
The
evergreen pines live long,<br />
Standing in the wind proud and strong.<br />
The big
fish seems to get to the sea.<br />
Only to
find a dream that is empty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style: A Pair of Loving Mandarin Ducks Floating
in the Stream.<br />
</strong>A pair of flying geese, each head
off in their own direction.<br />
When it
rains, the love birds fly away deserting their companion.<br />
Opportunity
knocks but usually too late, never too soon.<br />
The
leaves and flowers may decay but the roots will stay.<br />
In late
autumn they will absorb the energy of the cool moon.<br />
Life is
like an evergreen tree.Luck is
like a big fish swimming in shallow waters.<br />
One day
you can climb the ladder from heaven, which will lead you to paradise.</p>
