<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<span style="letter-spacing: 0pt; word-spacing: 0pt;">You are bold and courageous, yet you are
carefree. Your weakness is that you do not think ahead and plan carefully and
you are not persistent. If someone laughs at you once, you will change your
mind and alter your plans. Neither good luck nor bad luck will last. In your
early years you are strong and mobile, yet you feel disappointed and
discouraged in middle age. There are lots of unexpected difficulties in life.
Even though you may have a family, you have to spend time away from your spouse
and children. Friends are good company for entertainment only. They do not make
suitable business partners. To live the life of a monk or a nun is a good
solution.</span>

Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
The green willow tree surrounds the
city.<br />
The
blossoms are so light, as light as a feather.<br />
Yet,
strong winds cannot disperse them all,<br />
Despite
hardship, the family is still together</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
During
Tiger tail and Rabbit head, money will be made.<br />
Ox and Goat
will gain you a good name.<br />
Though risky under the mulberry tree shade,<br />
You will
not lose the way, finding acclaim.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
The
mandarin ducks are tired, so weary,<br />
Struggling
in the rain, so dreary.<br />
Though
the time is the spring season,<br />
There is
a lack of a good companion.<br />
Better to rest a while in lotus pond,<br />
And
watch the scared birds be gone.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
The peach blossoms are ever so
beautiful.<br />
Two
fruits are before the horse&#8217;s head.<br />
Elegant clothes they&#8217;ll wear in the
capital.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
The
evergreen pines live long,<br />
Standing in the wind proud and strong.<br />
The big
fish seems to get to the sea.<br />
Only to
find a dream that is empty.</p>

<p><strong>Style: A Pair of Loving Mandarin Ducks Floating
in the Stream.<br />
</strong>A pair of flying geese, each head
off in their own direction.<br />
When it
rains, the love birds fly away deserting their companion.<br />
Opportunity
knocks but usually too late, never too soon.<br />
The
leaves and flowers may decay but the roots will stay.<br />
In late
autumn they will absorb the energy of the cool moon.<br />
Life is
like an evergreen tree.Luck is
like a big fish swimming in shallow waters.<br />
One day
you can climb the ladder from heaven, which will lead you to paradise.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Work or other travels could lead to you spending time away from your family. It is important not be distracted from your goals by what other people say. You could find a lot of contentment from self-development and spiritual growth, as implied from “live the life of a monk or a nun”. The spiritual side of life is rewarding.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    Bad weather indicates difficult circumstances. Willow trees can bend, so you can adapt to changes. You might have started life facing hard times, yet there were positive scenarios too.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    At the end of Tiger years and at the start of the Rabbit years you can make money easily. During Ox and Goat years, you will gain a good reputation. In good times (“under the mulberry tree shade”) you will come across risky situations. However, you will not lose a way, but you will find the right action.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    Mandarin ducks are symbolic of a long-lasting couple. The verse hints at trials and tribulations when the tired mandarin ducks are struggling in the rain. Spring is symbolic of youth, so you might need to be patient before you meet your soulmate. Lotus pond means a pleasant place. To watch the scared birds be gone could mean that you are observing the mandarin ducks in the first line. When you notice other couples going through some strains with married life, you know you can be content with being single. On the other hand, this verse could also be interpreted to mean that you need to be aware that marriage requires effort to make it work. Enjoy being single when you are single.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Two fruits mean two children. To wear elegant clothes in the capital means they will be successful. If you do not have two beautiful and successful children this verse suggests you can lead capable people. 
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Evergreen pines are symbolic of living a long life. The pine trees can withstand all sorts of weather conditions, suggesting that even when you are under pressure you are strong enough to cope. The big fish have ambitions, yet when they reach the sea they realise they do not have as much influence in a larger setting.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    A pair of geese symbolises a long-lasting couple. The first two lines of this section are suggesting beware of romance stumbling under challenging circumstances. The leaves and flowers may decay but the roots will stay means that if you have built a firm foundation then you can handle changes. You can endure many different conditions because your life is like an evergreen tree. A big fish swimming in shallow waters moves awkwardly, but it still gets there. Luck is such that you will reach your goals and you will climb to the very top of the ladder of success.
