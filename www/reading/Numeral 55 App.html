<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>For this life, luck is mixed in the early
years.&nbsp; You have to work hard in
beginning, putting in your heart and soul, making a great effort.&nbsp; How you relate to your siblings is like how
ice gets along with burning charcoal. &nbsp;They do not thrive in each other&#8217;s company,
the burning charcoal melts the ice and the ice dampens the hot charcoal. In
this life, wealth is like clouds blown away by the wind. When you have worked
hard and had a great achievement, people will not appreciate your efforts. Distant
friends respect you. Yet, close relatives are not really close. It is suitable
to leave home and stay where you can stay.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Home is within
the four seas and five lakes.<br />
High
ambition, care not how much money makes.<br />
Complain
not about walking an extra mile, don&#8217;t grumble.<br />
Take out
fishing rod again and angle for the golden turtle.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Money is not an issue, instead seek power.<br />
Abundant wealth may bring problems
thereafter.<br />
Don&#8217;t take the ride, if you know it&#8217;s not
the right timing,<br />
A wise one will point out the right path
for where you are going.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Mandarin ducks look at each other
quite sadly.<br />
Wind
blows duckweed east and west, quite madly.<br />
When
moon sinks behind the trees, see the stars twinkling.<br />
There&#8217;s
plenty of time for listening to the cuckoo singing.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Late spring, a pair of flowers, two daughters.<br />
Notice there&#8217;s one
peach on the tree.<br />
As you cared for
the plants over a long history,<br />
Enjoy the glory
brought to your family.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
On meeting Geng and Yi to take care is right.<br />
After clouds disperse,
moon is very bright.<br />
Recall the
business in your past, reckon.<br />
Look back on the
beauty of green water and mountain</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Wild Geese Flying Over Cold River<br />
</strong>The way of making a living should be slow.<br />
You run one business after another.<br />
In the old garden, the flowers are
beautiful and worth your recollection.<br />
You should look for plenty more beautiful
places.<br />
Wild geese flying over the river can lose
their way.<br />
It will be mournful to see the peach in the
rain.<br />
Looking back on life there are a lot of regrets,
a lot of happiness.<br />
In Goat and Horse years, time to gain fame
and fortune.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can expect more support from friends than you can expect from relatives.
    It would be better for you if you leave your hometown and find somewhere else to live.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Home is within the four seas and five lakes,” means home can be anywhere you choose. You are highly ambitious and do more than is required because you want to be successful (“angle for the golden turtle”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    It is better for you to seek power rather than go after wealth. Get advice on how to develop your career (“a wise one will point out the right path”) and take the right opportunity at the right time (“Don’t take the ride, if you know it’s not the right timing”).
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    Travelling around can be disruptive to your relationship. You might spend a lot of time reflecting on your love life.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Two daughters (“flowers”) are predicted and possibly a son (“peach on the tree”). Because you nurtured your children (“cared for plants”) you can enjoy watching them succeed.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Geng years are those ending with digit 0, such as 1990, 2000, 2013, 2020. Yi years are those ending with digit 3, 1993, 2010, 2013, 2023.  Be cautious in Geng years and Yi years. After overcoming obstructions (“clouds dispersing”) in these years, you can enjoy good luck (“moon is bright”). “Green water and mountain” allude to the happy times you enjoyed.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can recall many successes (“flowers are beautiful”) and you have the motivation to have more achievement. “Wild geese flying over the river can lose their way” alludes to the possibility of you being distracted from your goals. “It will be mournful to see the peach in the rain,” suggests that you might be sad when you are aware of difficulties. Goat years and Horse years are lucky for finding success.
