<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>It is as if your destiny and luck cycles
are reversed, it is challenging to establish your career. &nbsp;When you are young, you may have a comfortable
family background, yet when you set out on your working life, you need to make
a lot of effort yourself.&nbsp; There are many
obstacles within the system that you have to overcome as you set about pursuing
your career. &nbsp;You often feel like giving up,
yet you need to persevere and not let it bother you.&nbsp; Relatives can easily desert you and accumulating
wealth is not easy. Yet, in times of misfortune, the situation can turn around
to good fortune.&nbsp; Watch out for what you
laugh about, for it can turn into something that is no laughing matter. Distant
friends understand you well.&nbsp; Those that
are supposed to be close to you, your siblings and relatives become your
enemies.&nbsp; Leave your hometown to find a new
life. &nbsp;This is a not an easy life for a
male, but for a female life is easier after you leave home.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
You&#8217;ll dream of your hometown for many
years.<br />
On the
road, in transit, reflecting on the old days,<br />
You
realize how life was rather sad, so full of tears,<br />
So you
decide to fight for a better life far away.<br />
In the
end, at sunset, fields and mulberry trees are yours.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
In Tiger years, improvement in your
situation.<br />
When Goat
year comes, you can smile, be happy.<br />
Making
money, in years of Rabbit and Monkey.<br />
Dog and
Rooster years, bring a good reputation.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
At sunrise, the golden bird sings,
black toad hops.<br />
Choosing
a spouse, good-looking or not?<br />
Clouds
disperse in clear sky, your heart will not skip.<br />
Starlit
sky shines over distant mountain.<br />
In the
pond, herons are standing.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Wild geese flying in the west wind,
time to go home.<br />
Three
flowers will bear more fruit,<br />
In your
later years, you&#8217;ll have a son.<br />
He&#8217;ll
not stay at your side, not this one.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Dog and Snake years you&#8217;ll be happy,<br />
Yet,
there&#8217;s still some anxiety.<br />
Whatever
you&#8217;re facing, you&#8217;ll react properly.<br />
Thus
you&#8217;ll avoid catastrophe.<br />
Like
riding a horse up the mountain,<br />
Take it
easy and fortune will come naturally.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Planting Plum Trees and Bamboo Alternately<br />
</strong>The sun
and moon tells you what is distinctly yin and yang.<br />
You are a person with strong morals.<br />
Whether it is fame or fortune, it will not
happen in the early years.<br />
Prosperity comes with Horse and Goat timing.<br />
You can go to the south-west to shoot the
arrows.<br />
One hundred flowers blossom during your
prime years.<br />
You are one who is rolling in the red dust
of the earth, the path is hard to tread.<br />
Take it easy do not be too ambitious in
this world.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Do not be disheartened when you face adversity because the situation can turn out to be lucky eventually. When it is the time to establish a career, you are better off leaving your hometown.

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    Beauty is only skin deep. Get to know somebody and see them clearly before you commit. Choose a spouse based on their character, and not just based on their appearance. 
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Three flowers will bear more fruit” means you will have three daughters.  They will bring you grandchildren. If you have a son later in life, he will have a life of his own. Some of your followers will bring more followers. A follower who comes late might not stick around.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Even when there are problems you can handle them. Dog and Snake years are good times. There is no need to be in a hurry for success, “riding a horse up the mountain” is done at a steady pace.
