        Do not be disheartened when you face adversity because the situation can turn out to be lucky eventually. When it is the time to establish a career, you are better off leaving your hometown.

<h3>Luck Verses</h3>



<accordion>
    <h3>Foundation</h3>
    <div>
        You have more luck when you leave your hometown, but you will miss home. “At sunset, fields with mulberry trees are yours” means that you will be successful in the end.
    </div>
    
    <h3>Life Path</h3>
    <div>
        Tiger and Goat years can turn out to be fortunate. Rabbit and Monkey years can be prosperous. You can become well known in Dog or Rooster years.

    <h3>Marriage</h3>
    <div>
        Beauty is only skin deep. Get to know somebody and see them clearly before you commit. Choose a spouse based on their character, and not just based on their appearance.
    </div>
    
    <h3>Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</h3>
    <div>
        “Three flowers will bear more fruit” means you will have three daughters.  They will bring you grandchildren. If you have a son later in life, he will have a life of his own. Some of your followers will bring more followers. A follower who comes late might not stick around.
    </div>
    

    <h3>Harvest</h3>
    <div>
        Even when there are problems you can handle them. Dog and Snake years are good times. There is no need to be in a hurry for success, “riding a horse up the mountain” is done at a steady pace.
    </div>
    


    <h3>Style</h3>
    <div>
        Success will not come early. “One hundred flowers blossom” means there will be good fortune. The south-west might be a significant direction or location. As long as you are not overly-ambitious you will not make life hard for yourself.
