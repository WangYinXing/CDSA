<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is like the blossom in the spring
forest and like the moon in autumn; the timing looks favorable. Although the
colors are beautiful in the scenery, it turns out to be fruitless.&nbsp; Living in modest conditions, the means of
making a living is dried up. You have to work very hard during daylight hours and
spend a lot of time thinking in the evening.&nbsp;
When you are advancing you are thinking of retreating. Because you are
frank and can offend people with your words, you need to watch what you say in
certain situations. Thereby, you can avoid your efforts being in vain, and your
diligent nature will not be wasted.&nbsp;
Nevertheless, ignoble people will be dissatisfied, they think you are not
doing enough. Relationship with relatives is like melting snow in late spring,
cold when it should be warm.&nbsp; Relationship
with siblings is like the reflection of flowers in the mirror, lacking in real
sentiment. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Watch the risky tower from afar, watch it wisely.<br />
Don&#8217;t approach the perilous place, don&#8217;t be
greedy.<br />
Don&#8217;t go in for the riches inside, don&#8217;t do
anything risky.<br />
When once again spring comes around again,<br />
Good tidings from dragon gate, suddenly
then.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Many sources of wealth, to ask there is no need.<br />
Success and failure comes naturally, no
worry.<br />
Right ahead, the road you see is lined with
mulberry trees.<br />
On jade pavilion enjoy bright moon and cool
breeze.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Travel a long way, return home after long absence.<br />
Marriage intact, being away no interference.<br />
Matchmaker brings you good tidings, good communication.<br />
Mandarin ducks play under flowers without
any suspicion.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Outside the wall, one flower, one
fruit, hanging.<br />
Trouble
with rain and wind when blossoming.<br />
In later
years, watch son having great achievement.<br />
Orchid and
jade blossoming within the fence; grandchildren.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
You are determined to live a long life.<br />
Watch out for the Rooster by the water.<br />
A picturesque scene of blue water, green
mountain,<br />
Under the moon, to crane and baboon listen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Clouds over the Terraced City<br />
</strong>With thick clouds over the end of the
horizon,<br />
When you are looking west at the capital
city, you cannot see your home.<br />
When spring is still chilly and flowers are
blossoming, cold rain at night is unwelcome.<br />
In late autumn the lonely flying goose is
landing on the cold sand.<br />
When it comes to other people who do not
have children, they can make changes more freely.<br />
Yet you cannot take such risks, you have to
work hard and wear out your shoes.<br />
What is good about this life? Where can you
enjoy life?<br />
In the little temple under bamboo and pine
shadow,<br />
Children have own life and cannot take care
of you.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Not expecting too much from others and being careful in what you say will help you get the most out of life.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    It would be wise to not rush into a risky proposition. Stand back and observe the situation. You will hear of another opportunity at the right place (“dragon gate”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    There are various ways of making money. Despite ups and downs, you find that you are on the road to success (“mulberry trees”). Eventually, you will enjoy good fortune in a luxurious place (“jade pavilion”).
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You might spend a lot of time apart from your spouse due to work. “Matchmaker brings you good tidings” means you only hear good things from other people whilst you are away. You maintain a happy marriage (“mandarin ducks play under flowers without suspicion”).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    One daughter (flower) and one son (fruit) are predicted. There might be difficulties at first with having children (“trouble with rain and wind when blossoming”). You will enjoy the company of your grandchildren (“orchid and jade blossoming within the fence”). For followers, they will turn out to be highly capable (“having great achievement”).
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Watch out for the Rooster by the water,” could have various meanings. It could mean to be careful near water during a Rooster year, or it could mean to be cautious in a Water Rooster year. You enjoy a retirement in a pleasant place.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You end up a long way from your hometown (“you cannot see your home”). Be cautious in your youth (“spring is still chilly”).  You go a long way on your own (“In late autumn the lonely flying goose is landing on the cold sand”). To “wear out your shoes” implies you work very hard going back and forth. To enjoy life in “the little temple under bamboo and pin shadow,” means retiring to a quiet place.
