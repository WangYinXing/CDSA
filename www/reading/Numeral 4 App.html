<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>
You are a handsome person, with clear
eyebrows and bright eyes. You have a noble character, which is well disciplined
and follows the rules.&nbsp; Although you have
a wide knowledge of many subjects, your understanding lacks depth.&nbsp; Perceptive of your own position, you know how
to distinguish between noble and ordinary people. Full of great ambitions, be
careful not to lose your way. When handling large amounts of money you are too
generous, yet with small amounts you are too tight-fisted, giving a somewhat
unbalanced outlook. Forget the past, lose the future, you know what to do. With
good experience you can turn misfortune into fortune. Even with bad luck you
will eventually find good fortune and wealth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
An
inheritance scattered far and wide,<br />
Crowing
rooster on the birch tree.<br />
Success
or failure what will it be?<br />
It&#8217;s hard
to say, enjoy each day.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
When meeting misfortune, cry not over
spilt water.<br />
There&#8217;s no need to confront problems, let
them be.<br />
Leave behind the hustle and bustle of the
city.<br />
Like a dragon in the wilderness, no need to
compete.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Startled mandarin ducks swim apart in
the pond.<br />
Laughing
at the tree blossoms dancing in the wind,<br />
Happy in
the Tiger&#8217;s den and the Dragon&#8217;s spring,<br />
Never
mind what the Rooster and Dog may bring.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
One branch of peach blossom in the wind.<br />
Peach fruits will
at most be three.<br />
Young phoenix of
another kind,<br />
Grow under bamboo,
to fly in time.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
On meeting the Snake, do not ask where
to find the road to happiness.<br />
On meeting
the Tiger, beware of Rat and Rooster.<br />
You
notice other people&#8217;s hearty laughter.<br />
Aware
you hear the rooster crow as the moon sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Nightingale Singing in Warm Spring<br />
</strong>An inheritance scattered here and there,&nbsp;<br />
Chickens cluck in the shadow of the tree.<br />
The baboons call out under a cold moon over
a mountain that&#8217;s empty.<br />
In the forest there are winds, so high, the
birds are far too tired to fly.<br />
Ducks and geese soar through the sky, flocks
flying in formation.<br />
Mandarin ducks hit by winds, have to find
their own way.<br />
Business brings dispute and gossip.<br />
The roots and the veins are set up.<br />
In this world, what is meant to be is happening.<br />
There is the unlimited beauty of nature,<br />
The plum blossoms in the snowy, early spring.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are ambitious and will be able to succeed eventually. Keep a sense of perspective and draw upon experience when persisting with your goals.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    What you inherit could be in different places. Since success and failure cannot always be predicted, enjoy life in the moment.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    There is no need to remain upset about bad luck. Accept certain situations the way they are. To be like a dragon in the wilderness means to seek a quiet life without feeling the need to compete.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    It can be a shock when a relationship ends. Nevertheless, there can be good times spent together laughing and dancing. Romance is happy in your youth (springtime). In later years you enjoy your own company.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    At most there will be three children. A young phoenix of another kind means you might adopt or foster a child into your family. If talking about followers, it can mean that you can have three loyal followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    In Snake year, expect some quiet times. In Tiger years beware of people born under Rat or Rooster signs, or beware of any sort of connections with Rat or Rooster. When you notice other people enjoying themselves, find your own peace of mind.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    Your inheritance is in more than one place. You might find yourself going here and there, and at times this can be tiring. When there is good organization (flocks flying in formation), you can achieve a great deal. You may have to part during difficult times in a romantic relationship. Doing business can bring dispute and gossip, but you can withstand difficulties because you have a strong foundation (roots and veins). Remember that there are many good things in life (unlimited beauty of nature).
