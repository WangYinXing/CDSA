<p><strong>Destiny:</strong></p>
<p>You are a handsome person, with clear
eyebrows and bright eyes. You have a noble character, which is well disciplined
and follows the rules.&nbsp; Although you have
a wide knowledge of many subjects, your understanding lacks depth.&nbsp; Perceptive of your own position, you know how
to distinguish between noble and ordinary people. Full of great ambitions, be
careful not to lose your way. When handling large amounts of money you are too
generous, yet with small amounts you are too tight-fisted, giving a somewhat
unbalanced outlook. Forget the past, lose the future, you know what to do. With
good experience you can turn misfortune into fortune. Even with bad luck you
will eventually find good fortune and wealth.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
An
inheritance scattered far and wide,<br />
Crowing
rooster on the birch tree.<br />
Success
or failure what will it be?<br />
It&#8217;s hard
to say, enjoy each day.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
When meeting misfortune, cry not over
spilt water.<br />
There&#8217;s no need to confront problems, let
them be.<br />
Leave behind the hustle and bustle of the
city.<br />
Like a dragon in the wilderness, no need to
compete.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Startled mandarin ducks swim apart in
the pond.<br />
Laughing
at the tree blossoms dancing in the wind,<br />
Happy in
the Tiger&#8217;s den and the Dragon&#8217;s spring,<br />
Never
mind what the Rooster and Dog may bring.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
One branch of peach blossom in the wind.<br />
Peach fruits will
at most be three.<br />
Young phoenix of
another kind,<br />
Grow under bamboo,
to fly in time.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
On meeting the Snake, do not ask where
to find the road to happiness.<br />
On meeting
the Tiger, beware of Rat and Rooster.<br />
You
notice other people&#8217;s hearty laughter.<br />
Aware
you hear the rooster crow as the moon sets.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Nightingale Singing in Warm Spring<br />
</strong>An inheritance scattered here and there,&nbsp;<br />
Chickens cluck in the shadow of the tree.<br />
The baboons call out under a cold moon over
a mountain that&#8217;s empty.<br />
In the forest there are winds, so high, the
birds are far too tired to fly.<br />
Ducks and geese soar through the sky, flocks
flying in formation.<br />
Mandarin ducks hit by winds, have to find
their own way.<br />
Business brings dispute and gossip.<br />
The roots and the veins are set up.<br />
In this world, what is meant to be is happening.<br />
There is the unlimited beauty of nature,<br />
The plum blossoms in the snowy, early spring.</p>
<p><br />
