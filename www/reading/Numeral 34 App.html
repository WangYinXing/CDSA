<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>You are like a sheep dressed in tiger&#8217;s
clothing.&nbsp; In your straw house there is
an animal head trophy. A straw house is pretty but it is not practical, it will
be collapse when pushed. With the Retreating Spirit, bringing unluckiness,
there is no fame and fortune.&nbsp; A suspicious
character, you are not a straightforward person and you are full of flattery. There
is not much of a relationship between you and your siblings.&nbsp; You are not particularly friendly with your
family. You talk about people behind their back, but your heart is in a good
place. Many a time you fail, because you do not communicate with people.&nbsp; When everything looks right, it is time for
you to cry. Even without meaning to, you can hurt your spouse and children. You
break up your family, but your family will be re-united again. Amongst all the
misfortune there will be fortune.&nbsp; You
are like a jade in the rock that will eventually show its brilliant side. It is
like the image of a pearl hidden in deep waters.&nbsp;</p>

The tree blossoms and bears fruit.<br />
A couple of fish jump out of your pond.<br />
Whatever you plan may not be successful.<br />
Whatever you want to be enjoyable may not
be enjoyable.<br />
Whatever you do in your career, you should
prepare another path.<br />
With persistence, you will live an
enjoyable life.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are a mild person who puts on a cloak of bravado (“sheep dressed in tiger’s clothing”). A trophy hanging on the wall of a straw house is another metaphor for your life; things can look good without being practical. The “Retreating Spirit” means setbacks. Your nature is like hidden treasure buried deep underground that will eventually be unearthed, and shine in the daylight (“You are like jade in the rock that will eventually show its brilliant side”). 
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “When opening a pond or digging a well, you will get pearls that are precious,” suggests that when you are going about your own business, you find great rewards. To “wear a golden belt with robes of purple” means you have wealth and power.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    You will have success (“the stars will shine over the river”) even though you go through good times (“rain and dew bringing sweetness”) or challenging times (“wind and frost makes you shiver”).
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Fish carry messages to each other” means messages are passed between husband and wife when you are apart.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Two sons are predicted. “Arriving before spring is over,” suggests that you have children when you are young. Because of good karma from your charitable acts, your sons will have achievement. For followers, you can attract successful followers early on.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    During Tiger, Monkey, Rabbit and Horse years you can get what you want (“ride the cloud in the wind to reach your destination”). “Under the moonlight at dawn, birds are singing” alludes to a very peaceful scene towards the end of your life.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The tree blossoms and bears fruit” suggests you see good rewards, whereas “A couple of fish jump out of your pond” implies that you might incur some losses.
