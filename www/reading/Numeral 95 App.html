<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is one where making a living starts
early and retiring comes late. You will be rowing a sampan alone in the wind
and waves. Encountering the wild fierce tiger in the mountain at night, in an
embarrassing situation you can get away.&nbsp;
You know when to advance and when to retreat. You have the intention to
complete things successfully, but you can also kill something with your words. There
is no need to worry about minor hassles and major troubles will be
removed.&nbsp; What is a pity is that your
relatives are like water, tasteless, and they become competitors. Do not
complain about such unloving situations because it is your life.</p>

Work
hard along the winding path for fame and fortune.<br />
Boundless
view of breeze and moon with fragrance of cinnamon,<br />
When you
go forward, you&#8217;ll see vibrant mulberry and beautiful chrysanthemum.<br />
The
scenery in the fields is very unusual, very uncommon.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
In the olden days nothing was steady,<br />
A lot of effort to bring up your family.<br />
Goat and Dog years be understanding,<br />
With your son, climb up success mountain.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Marriage is like testing the waters,
is it deep or is it shallow?<br />
Marriage
is like the moon, sometimes new, sometimes full.<br />
In the
end, fame and fortune bring you luck, you&#8217;ll be lucky.<br />
Friends
come to celebrate, enjoy lots of good company.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Wonderful scene, peach is fragrant.<br />
Fruits on the
branch, they will ripen.<br />
Support you give
them is important,<br />
All your children
have great achievement.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Do not take the boat in Rabbit or Dragon years,<br />
By the waterside there are worries and
fears.<br />
Water dragon in crystal palace you&#8217;d be
visiting,<br />
If instead of fishing from the shore, you
went boating.</p>

Everyone says you will be lost in the
dangerous place.<br />
Who knows there is a road leading to
success?<br />
When you come home don&#8217;t bother to polish
the mirror to look at yourself.<br />
Rather go out to grind and polish your
rusty sword.<br />
If it were not for your brave determination,
how can you be successful and jump up to the nine clouds from the plain level
ground.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    There could be a lot of complications when it comes to family relationships. You can choose not to engage in arguments. You are self-reliant (“rowing a sampan alone in the wind and waves”). Life is more enjoyable in your later years.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Boundless view of breeze and moon with fragrance of cinnamon,” means there are plenty of opportunities. To see “vibrant mulberry and beautiful chrysanthemum,” means there is abundance in mid-life. Your success could be viewed as unconventional (“scenery in the fields is very unusual,”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    During Goat and Dog years, you need to understand others. Along with your son, you can gain success.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You might be cautious about marriage (“testing the waters’). If you understand that relationships go through changes (“like the moon, sometimes new, sometimes full”) you will realise that you are fortunate when it comes to love and romance.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Because you nurture your children, they will turn out to be successful. For followers, you can lead some highly capable ones.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    To avoid any untoward events in Rabbit years or Dragon years, stay on dry land and do not cross water by boat.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are not afraid of taking risks (“Goose flying in strong winds in high heavens”) and proceed with courage (“Travel on horseback with whip in brave style”). When you succeed you see no need for introspection (“don’t bother to polish the mirror to look at yourself”). Instead you prepare yourself to fight another battle (“grind and polish your rusty sword”). To “jump up to the nine clouds” means to aim high, to be ambitious. Bravery and persistence will bring you great success.
