<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>When this star is shining on your life
there will be a lot of gossip. Whatever you do there are a lot of crooked
paths. You can gain real power that does not depend on you giving flattery to
your superiors. It is easy for you to be happy and easy for you to get angry.&nbsp; In this life, it is easy to get glory and
easy to get shame.&nbsp; You cannot hide even
small secrets.&nbsp; You believe in standing
up and speaking your mind, sometimes even with hurtful language. There is room
for improvement in your social and human relationship skills, which are not
satisfactory.&nbsp; Your relatives can be two-faced
and it is like they hold a knife behind their laughing faces.&nbsp; Parents are like a candle in the wind.</p>

Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Everything looks great when moon is above centre of the sky.<br />
In autumn, a gust of wind stirs up the
waves as it blows by.<br />
Those who know you gather together on the
east river.<br />
When time comes you will go to the nine
heavens together,<br />
Group of friends working get success
thereafter.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
To finish the job, you have to do things repeatedly.<br />
Just remember you&#8217;ll make a name in this
world, no doubt.<br />
Hidden talent like jade buried in the field
before it&#8217;s dug out.<br />
A skillful sculptor makes it something
gorgeous eventually.<br />
Someone will come along who knows how to
use your ability.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
The plum in winter makes the riverside
good scenery.<br />
Pine
trees grow to reach heaven, standing firmly.<br />
Appreciate
bright moon and cool breeze with good company.<br />
Enjoy
green mountains and deep rivers, lot of fun, so merry.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
New branches are coming out on the pine.<br />
A pair of fairy cranes on top of forest.<br />
What a pity when bright moon is shadowed by
wind and rain.<br />
Do good deeds before your children can
prosper and gain.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Green mountains and clear streams,<br />
Behind
closed door hear bells toll across fields.<br />
Bright
moon shines over deep green pine trees.<br />
Baboon and crane in the wilderness you
befriend.<br />
Enjoy a good retirement life in the end.</p>

</strong>Moon in mid-sky develops a long shadow.<br />
You&#8217;ll be holding the golden seal in Geng,

You are rowing a sampan on misty river.<br />
There&#8217;ll be huge turtle hiding under deep
waters.<br />
Wild geese call each other to fly in

Flowers in second moon become peach fruits.<br />
Don&#8217;t care about many difficulties in your
life.<br />
When you are old, you will be facing golden
gate and meeting noble friends.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Life is often not straightforward (“a lot of crooked paths”), yet you can hold authority. By learning how to get along better with others, you can make life easier for yourself.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Everything looks great when moon is above center of the sky” suggests that life is full of hope during good times. “In autumn, a gust of wind stirs up the waves as it blows by,” implies that in later years there could be challenges. When you do a joint venture (“gather together on the east river”), it will turn out to be successful (“go to nine heavens”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    You need to persist in order to succeed. When your talents are recognised and appreciated, you will gain a good reputation.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    The prediction is for a satisfying relationship lasting until you are elderly (“plum in winter”).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “New branches are coming out on the pine, a pair of fairy cranes on top of forest,” suggests that you have good children. Since they may face difficulties (“wind and rain”), you can create good karma with your charitable behaviour to bring about better luck for your children. For followers, you can expect good followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You enjoy a happy retirement with pets (baboon and crane) in the countryside.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Moon in mid-sky develops a long shadow,” suggests that you find yourself in a promising situation (no clouds covering the moon). You can gain authority (“holding the golden seal” during Geng years (years ending with digit 0, e.g. 1990, 2000, 2010, 2020) or Xin years (years ending with digit 1, e.g. 1991, 2001, 2011, 2021). “You are rowing a sampan on misty river” implies you go on a journey where the way ahead is not always clear. However, there is something good waiting to be found (“huge turtle hiding under deep waters”). “Wild geese call each other to fly in different formation,” suggests some sort of re-organization. “Flowers in second moon become peach fruits” implies that you start something in your early days leads to good results. You will enjoy good times at the end of your life (“facing golden gate and meeting noble friends”).
