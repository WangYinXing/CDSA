<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This life is like the floating cloud coming
over the mountain. The wild crane is calling in the wind. Your mind is
everywhere and your ambition is elsewhere. You will not be successful by
depending on your ancestors, but you can establish yourself by leaving your
hometown. Wealth is like spring water in the well, it is auspicious. Yet your
life is like a candle in the wind. Two or three times you change in social
status. Starting from scratch, you re-establish your family four or five times.
&nbsp;As a layman you are not lonely.&nbsp; In disastrous situations there is the Rescuing
Spirit following you and you can seek sanctuary in a monastery. Becoming a monk
is not the final outcome. Leaving the monastery to revert to a life of a
layman, there is the Retreating Spirit to bother you. &nbsp;Destiny has your spouse and children leaving
you. Siblings have to part from you. When luck is not with you, you have to use
your energy.&nbsp; The best way is to walk on
leisurely ground, but destiny has you falling into the fire pit.</p>
