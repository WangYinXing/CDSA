<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is like the floating cloud coming
over the mountain. The wild crane is calling in the wind. Your mind is
everywhere and your ambition is elsewhere. You will not be successful by
depending on your ancestors, but you can establish yourself by leaving your
hometown. Wealth is like spring water in the well, it is auspicious. Yet your
life is like a candle in the wind. Two or three times you change in social
status. Starting from scratch, you re-establish your family four or five times.
&nbsp;As a layman you are not lonely.&nbsp; In disastrous situations there is the Rescuing
Spirit following you and you can seek sanctuary in a monastery. Becoming a monk
is not the final outcome. Leaving the monastery to revert to a life of a
layman, there is the Retreating Spirit to bother you. &nbsp;Destiny has your spouse and children leaving
you. Siblings have to part from you. When luck is not with you, you have to use
your energy.&nbsp; The best way is to walk on
leisurely ground, but destiny has you falling into the fire pit.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    The “Rescuing Spirit” is the sort of good luck that arrives when you need it the most. The “Retreating Spirit” is the sort of luck that brings you setbacks. To “seek sanctuary in monastery” can mean putting time into self-development, as well as the literal meaning. “Destiny has you falling into the fire pit” alludes to you encountering bad luck. It would benefit you to be more focused, and to move away from your hometown to establish yourself independently.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    When you reach middle age your goals become a lot clearer. At that time your luck improves (“bright moon in clear sky gets brighter”). Goat years and Dog years are lucky for achievement.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “On peach tree, pine nuts are growing. Ox and Goat years bring good earnings,” suggests that Ox and Goat years are lucky for gaining wealth. To “wear golden belt with purple robe in maple forest” implies that when you have wealth and influence you can mingle with those in high society.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    When you are happily married (“mandarin ducks play”) you need to be careful about getting involved in extra-marital liaisons.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Three children are predicted (“three fruits are hanging”). However, there might also be another unexpected child (“one fruit comes out of the mountain”). For followers, you can more followers than you expected.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can look back on a happy life (“visitor on earth”). The idea here is that you are spiritual being, and the time you spend on earth is like visiting an interesting place, but your true home is in the spiritual world. Rat year or Horse year are likely times for you to move to another place.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Black clouds disperse, so you can see blue sky” implies that there is hope for the future, after you have been waiting for something to happen (“sitting on fishing pier”). You will see a way to develop for the future (“red dust is carried away by the wind then you can see the green bamboo under the moon”). You realise how you can use your abilities to make the world a better place.
