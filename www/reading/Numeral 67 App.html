<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is like the orchid in the quiet
valley or it is like the pine and cedar flourishing in the mountains. You
cannot work together with your siblings. What is left by parents cannot be
retained.&nbsp; It is suitable to start own
business or escape into the monastery.&nbsp;
Closeness with relatives is like the falling leaves in autumn wind. Friendships
are like ice in rivers in spring. There are a lot of ups and downs in life. Fame
and fortune comes and goes. To have political success is out of the question. Eventually
you will be just somebody relaxing in the woods.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
<strong>Luck Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Row, row, row your boat over the five lakes.<br />
Go with the wind into rival countries.<br />
Change jobs with different companies.<br />
Face a lot of difficult situations, under
pressure.<br />
Because of your virtues can get near to the
source of power.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Recollecting
the days near Horse&#8217;s head and by side of Dragon,<br />
When unexpected
happiness came from heaven,<br />
Your
ability appreciated by a powerful person.<br />
In your
career, took you up to a high position,<br />
Like a
helping hand to climb up the mountain.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
To play music with you, an elegant spouse
is found.<br />
Sadness doesn&#8217;t come from the beautiful
sound.<br />
For many years sail together in the high
tide.<br />
Who is appreciating beautiful musical notes
with you?</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Don&#8217;t complain about being lonely when
old.<br />
In late
years, twin sons are coming, it is foretold.<br />
Recollecting
old family is sad, you sigh.<br />
Drink and get drunk to enjoy life.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
At times of Yin or Shen, in year of
Bing Zi.<br />
It&#8217;s easy to miss an opportunity.<br />
Green mountains, blue waters still found,<br />
Means opportunities are always around.<br />
Go on board the boat for fishing,<br />
And in the east wind you&#8217;re bathing.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Spring Flowers and Autumn Leaves<br />
</strong>Sail alone on five lakes in a sampan.<br />
Go east, west, south, north commuting
between countries.<br />
You have brief happiness in spring when the
flowers bloom.<br />
By autumn you come back to reality but the trees
are already bare.<br />
Where you fish should be stable in the calm
lake.<br />
Wild goose is flying alone in the high sky.<br />
You are a person struggling in the red dust
of worldly life.<br />
Why not brush away red dust and examine the
Buddha&#8217;s picture?<br />
Jump out of the chaotic worldly life and
study Buddha&#8217;s thoughts.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    It would suit you to be independent of your family and to develop your own career 
    (“like the orchid in the quiet valley or it is like the pine and cedar flourishing in the mountains”). It might also be a good idea for you to follow a religious or spiritual path (escape into the monastery).
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Row, row, row your boat over the five lakes, go with the wind to rival countries” means you go all over the place and work for different companies.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Recollecting the days near Horse’s head and by side of Dragon, when unexpected happiness came from heaven,” means good times in Horse years and Dragon years.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    A harmonious and lasting relationship with an attractive partner is predicted.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Twin sons are predicted and you will be an older parent. Let go of any unhappiness you might feel about your own family background. For followers, you can expect some loyal male followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “At times of Yin or Shen,” means a Tiger (Yin) year or a Monkey (Shen) year. A Bing Zi year is a Fire Rat year. A Fire Rat year occurs once every 60 years, e.g. 1936,1996, 2056. “Go on board the boat for fishing, and in the east wind you’re bathing” implies that if you take up an opportunity you can prosper.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You travel all over the place (“Sail alone on five lakes in a sampan”). “You have brief happiness in spring when the flowers bloom” implies you can enjoy success when you are young. You are unlikely to have the same achievement in your later years (“By autumn, you come back to reality but the trees are already bare,”). Therefore, it would be sensible for you to aim to make a steady living (“Where you fish should be stable in the calm lake”).  When you face difficult times (“struggling with the red dust of worldly life”), consider seeking sanctuary in spiritual studies.
