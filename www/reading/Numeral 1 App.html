<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>You are clever and ambitious, yet lonely.
In many ways you are extra-ordinary. Whilst you may gain much knowledge, your
achievement is limited. Studying by rote learning works well for you because
you have an amazing power for memorizing information. Stepping into middle age,
you will become more and more solitary. Nevertheless, in your forties you will
meet a lot of helpful people. However, you can only gain social entertainment
from your helpful friends rather than reap any financial rewards in business.
Your life luck is such that big troubles will become small and small troubles
will disappear. Just as well, since you are too hesitant in decision-making.
Friends are easily lost and solitude becomes your enjoyment. With indecision as
a weakness you miss a lot of opportunities. Although you are proud, you do not
like to flatter others. You are open-minded and good causes are where you
prefer to spend money. Nobody would describe you as miserly. With high aims in
life, no one can stop you from doing what you truly want. Your children have
their own life. Eventually, you will be an empty nester. What a pity, this is a
semi-monk's life.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Your wits are so quick, as quick as
lightning.<br />
With a
loud, clear voice the world finds you frightening.<br />
Unable
to settle down you go here and there, wandering.<br />
In a
huge, great world, but where are you heading?</p>
Life Path:<br />
Ready to shoot with your bow and arrow.<br />
Killing
deer, then presenting it to the wealthy.<br />
Eventually
gold and jade fill your abode.<br />
Dragon
and Tiger years turn out to be most lucky.&nbsp;
<p>Marriage:<br />
At home together play musical instruments.<br />
Enjoy life even in tough situations.<br />
Amongst the trees of cinnamon,<br />
In the back garden a wild bud blossoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Spring blossom comes late.<br />
Winds so
strong, so great.<br />
Still
one red apricot, that&#8217;s alright,<br />
It makes
the back garden look so bright.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
On meeting Xin and Ren, stay put, stay
for long.<br />
It&#8217;s only suitable for enjoying music and song.<br />
When the Rooster sings by the river, it&#8217;s time to dream.<br />
Life is like flowers carried by the gurgling stream.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Style: Distant Thunder Style<br />
</strong>In the distant sky, lightning flashes and thunder sounds.<br />
Wild winds blow from all directions,
knowing no bounds.<br />
As the clouds disperse, the loving birds ford the stream.<br />
Flowers hit by wind and rain, some petals
fall down.<br />
From
north to south, travelling in different lands,<br />
Moving
home all the time, like shifting sands.<br />
What is
the end of the story, may I ask?<br />
Leading
a child by a bamboo, is the task.Food and clothes are changing,<br />
Finding love is like sifting,<br />
Gold from sand, slowly by hand.<br />
A person dressed in purple comes to your
rescue.</p>
