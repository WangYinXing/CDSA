<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>
    You are clever and ambitious, yet lonely.
    In many ways you are extra-ordinary. Whilst you may gain much knowledge, your
    achievement is limited. Studying by rote learning works well for you because
    you have an amazing power for memorizing information. Stepping into middle age,
    you will become more and more solitary. Nevertheless, in your forties you will
    meet a lot of helpful people. However, you can only gain social entertainment
    from your helpful friends rather than reap any financial rewards in business.
    Your life luck is such that big troubles will become small and small troubles
    will disappear. Just as well, since you are too hesitant in decision-making.
    Friends are easily lost and solitude becomes your enjoyment. With indecision as
    a weakness you miss a lot of opportunities. Although you are proud, you do not
    like to flatter others. You are open-minded and good causes are where you
    prefer to spend money. Nobody would describe you as miserly. With high aims in
    life, no one can stop you from doing what you truly want. Your children have
    their own life. Eventually, you will be an empty nester. What a pity, this is a
    semi-monk's life.
</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Your wits are so quick, as quick as
lightning.<br />
With a
loud, clear voice the world finds you frightening.<br />
Unable
to settle down you go here and there, wandering.<br />
In a
huge, great world, but where are you heading?</p>
Life Path:<br />
Ready to shoot with your bow and arrow.<br />
Killing
deer, then presenting it to the wealthy.<br />
Eventually
gold and jade fill your abode.<br />
Dragon
and Tiger years turn out to be most lucky.&nbsp;
<p>Marriage:<br />
At home together play musical instruments.<br />
Enjoy life even in tough situations.<br />
Amongst the trees of cinnamon,<br />
In the back garden a wild bud blossoms.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Spring blossom comes late.<br />
Winds so
strong, so great.<br />
Still
one red apricot, that&#8217;s alright,<br />
It makes
the back garden look so bright.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
On meeting Xin and Ren, stay put, stay
for long.<br />
It&#8217;s only suitable for enjoying music and song.<br />
When the Rooster sings by the river, it&#8217;s time to dream.<br />
Life is like flowers carried by the gurgling stream.&nbsp;</p>
<p><br />
<strong>Style: Distant Thunder Style<br />
</strong>In the distant sky, lightning flashes and thunder sounds.<br />
Wild winds blow from all directions,
knowing no bounds.<br />
As the clouds disperse, the loving birds ford the stream.<br />
Flowers hit by wind and rain, some petals
fall down.<br />
From
north to south, travelling in different lands,<br />
Moving
home all the time, like shifting sands.<br />
What is
the end of the story, may I ask?<br />
Leading
a child by a bamboo, is the task.Food and clothes are changing,<br />
Finding love is like sifting,<br />
Gold from sand, slowly by hand.<br />
A person dressed in purple comes to your
rescue.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can achieve your goals, and you can do it largely on your own. A “semi-monk’s life” implies you are somebody who can enjoy their own company, and may have spiritual leanings.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    There are indications that you are unsure of where you are going. You might take your time to find your life purpose.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    You set your sights to achieve your ambitions when “ready to shoot with bow and arrow”. Success follows because you did what was needed to reach your goals. Gold and jade filling your abode means that you can live in a luxurious home.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    To play musical instruments together is a metaphor for a harmonious couple relationship, where you share entertainment. There is much love for many children and the wild bud could be an adopted child or stepchild.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Children (or followers) are likely to come late. There could be many grandchildren. In old age, a daughter to keep you company. If talking about followers, it could mean that you have a loyal follower who brings you more followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Xin and Ren refer to years. Xin refers to the heavenly stem of the year. Xin years are those years ending in the digit 1, e.g. 1991, 2001, 2011, 2021, etc. Ren years are those years ending in the digit 2, e.g. 1992, 2002, 2012, 2022 etc. You can relax (listen to music) in Xin and Ren years because not a lot happens.
    Rooster could refer to Rooster years when there is likely to be some sort of movement suggested by the gurgling stream.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    Be prepared for sudden, unexpected changes of circumstances when there is thunder and lightning and winds blowing from all directions. Moving house many times is foretold by travelling in different lands. In old age you can walk along holding a grandchild’s hand, as suggested by ‘leading a child by a bamboo’. When it comes to finding true love, you might meet many suitors before you find the one. A person dressed in purple could be taken literally, or it could mean someone who has power and influence will come to your rescue. This helpful person turns up when needed, but the situation is not serious anyway.
