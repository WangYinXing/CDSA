<p><strong>Destiny<br />
</strong>Your fate is full of trials and
tribulations. You encounter a lot of adversity in your early days. Relatives are
as cold as ice and siblings are hard-hearted. Just like the fish in the water,
you know how warm or cold the water feels and can gauge the atmosphere. The
tiger and wolves will not hurt their own kind. It feels like you are walking
bare-footed amongst the thorns.&nbsp; However,
there are lucky stars to come to your rescue. When you are at ease, troubles
knock on your door to disturb you. When you are busy eventually you have some
happy tidings. It is all because of the Retreating Spirit in your life making
things tricky for you all the time.</p>
