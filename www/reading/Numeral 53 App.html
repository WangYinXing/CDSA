<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>Your fate is full of trials and
tribulations. You encounter a lot of adversity in your early days. Relatives are
as cold as ice and siblings are hard-hearted. Just like the fish in the water,
you know how warm or cold the water feels and can gauge the atmosphere. The
tiger and wolves will not hurt their own kind. It feels like you are walking
bare-footed amongst the thorns.&nbsp; However,
there are lucky stars to come to your rescue. When you are at ease, troubles
knock on your door to disturb you. When you are busy eventually you have some
happy tidings. It is all because of the Retreating Spirit in your life making
things tricky for you all the time.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
The fortunate god comes to you naturally.<br />
Because of good deeds you will receive<br />
News of promotion or conception, via your
dreams, &nbsp;<br />
Good omen of the qi lin, the fortunate
beast.<br />
Gorgeous guests at your home to party and
feast.<br />
Pine
trees and orchids dance in the wind from the east.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Enjoy natural success because you&#8217;re charitable.<br />
Return from battle with glory when you&#8217;re a
general,<br />
And for your brothers this will be most
beneficial.<br />
Even after you have passed away, you gain
lots of honor.<br />
For all these good things you should thank
the emperor.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Many from good families would like to be your spouse.<br />
Many sons running
around like a noble house.<br />
Regrets in your
later years, time has flown.<br />
Enjoy bright moon
and cool breeze all alone.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Three flowers blossom in yellow and green,<br />
Both sons and daughters can be seen.<br />
One fruit on the east wall is most
outstanding.<br />
When you&#8217;re old, the fruits you&#8217;re
watching,<br />
Get better with each branch.<br />
Each offspring becomes more dazzling.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Dragon or Snake year, it&#8217;s time to return.<br />
There is no way this may alter,<br />
Like change not mountain or river.<br />
Orchids will be beautiful under the sun,<br />
Then time to set sail to the nine heavens.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Hibiscus in Autumn<br />
</strong>Your fight for fame and fortune it is not
without regrets.<br />
It leaves your energies exhausted.<br />
Lose all your assets because of your
destiny.<br />
Do not blame heaven for your problems with
your siblings and children.<br />
Like wild geese flying over mountains until
their wings are tired.<br />
One flower blossoms in the cold mountain.<br />
Eventually you will meet an old friend with
whom you will find success, climbing high and overlooking the clouds below.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The tiger and wolves will not hurt their own kind,” means that even though relatives might be aloof, they will not harm you. The Retreating Spirit refers to setbacks, yet when you are in difficulty, luck will save you.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The fortunate god comes to you naturally” means that there will be fortunate events. The qi lin is a Chinese unicorn that comes in dreams and brings good news, particularly of the birth of a child or of career developments. “Pine trees and orchids dance in the wind from the east” alludes to good times.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Return from battle with glory when you’re a general,” does not necessarily mean you have a military career; it suggests that you can be a successful leader. To “thank the emperor” implies that you are grateful for the support you get from mentors.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You attract a lot of romantic interest, therefore, you have plenty of choice as to whom to marry. Make the most of family life.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    At least three children are predicted, and you have both sons and daughters. You have an outstanding son who gives you wonderful grandchildren.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    In a Dragon year or a Snake year you are likely to go back to somewhere familiar. There will be a beautiful ending to your life.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are prepared to go far (“wild geese flying over mountains until their wings are tired”) to pursue an opportunity you can see in the distance (“one flower blossoms in the cold mountain”).
