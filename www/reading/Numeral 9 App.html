<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>You are born under the fame and fortune
star, the star of career success. You establish your own rules and build your
own business. The wind will blow away dead plants. Three will come to you late:
get rich late, marry late and enjoy life late.&nbsp;
Three will come early: shouldering the responsibility of the family
early, using your brain early, worrying and working hard early.&nbsp;&nbsp; There is someone coming to your rescue, so
you can escape litigation.&nbsp; Adversity
turns out to be not too serious.&nbsp; What
appears to be excellent at first sight turns out to be not so good.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
At first, rowing a boat on dry land.<br />
Close
your doors and worry in vain.<br />
In Ox or
Horse year it is time to go to a distant land,<br />
Follow
the snowy path between two mountains.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Decaying peach in the rain, candle in
the wind.<br />
Be
satisfied with what you have got.<br />
When you
see the mulberry tree, start harvesting.<br />
When the
boat stops, enjoy the nightingale singing in valley.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
All day long, mandarin ducks are
swimming.<br />
The
female is laid-back, the male is hard working.<br />
In the
end all the water birds have flown away<br />
To the
land of flowers and fruits, a move to fairyland.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
The blossoms are blooming on lustrous
tree,<br />
How many
branches?&nbsp; Two or three?<br />
Flowers
are accompanied by leaves to become jade and gold.<br />
To the
dragon palace and phoenix pavilion, the people go.<br />
Your
children have achievement to behold.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Retirement happens in the year of the
Ox or Goat.<br />
In Ox
year you will meet success.<br />
Petals
strewn all over the road of leisure,<br />
A beautiful
blanket for you to walk on.<br />
Moon shines
on plum blossom with a leisurely shadow.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Beautiful Grass in the Spring<br />
</strong>Grass is still green in the spring.<br />
When you have snow, the flowers have rotten
branches.<br />
Siblings are of no use, it is as if you
have none.<br />
Life is destined to be solitary.<br />
Peach blossom in rain, candle in the wind.<br />
You are forever busy because you are not
content.<br />
There are two or three branches with
flowers, only one branch turns red or green to denote you will succeed.<br />
There is only one pillar to support your
business.<br />
For every success, there is something to
worry about.&nbsp;<br />
During the year of Dragon, Goat, Dog or Ox
you can harvest beautiful chrysanthemums.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Success and satisfaction will come to you after hard work. “Wind will blow away dead plants” means it will be apparent to you what is not worth pursuing any further.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Rowing a boat on dry land” means you exert a lot of effort without going very far. “Close your doors and worry in vain” suggests that you cannot make much progress staying where you are, therefore you need to move away from your hometown. An Ox year or a Horse year are the right timing for moving to somewhere far away.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Decaying peach in the rain, candle in the wind” evokes the imagery of someone who is vulnerable in harsh circumstances, yet still fights on. You need to learn to be satisfied with what you have during difficult times. Mulberry trees are symbolic of good times. When the good times come you can reap the rewards. In the end, you can stop and enjoy yourself.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    A long-lasting marriage is predicted by mandarin ducks swimming all day long. You can enjoy some amazing times in a wonderful place.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Blossoms and branches refer to children. You are likely to have two or three children. Jade and gold together with dragon palace and phoenix pavilion are evocative of wealth and status. Your children will have outstanding achievement. For followers, two or three of your followers will be highly successful.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    When you walk on a beautiful blanket of petals is a very pleasant and satisfying situation. Plum blossom is associated with winter, and winter means the final years of your life. The shining moon is symbolic of good fortune. You can look forward to happy and relaxed times towards the end.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Grass is still green in spring” suggests there is hope and optimism. When it snows and times are difficult, you cannot get a lot of support. You can face challenging circumstances, “peach blossom in the rain, candle in the wind”. Even though not every attempt will turn out to be successful, you will eventually succeed.  To “harvest beautiful chrysanthemums” means to celebrate your accomplishments.
