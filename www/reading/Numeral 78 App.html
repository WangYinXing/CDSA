<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>You establish a career, which is not based
on your inheritance. How you make a living is independent of your relatives. The
means for your lifestyle comes like the grass in spring, which does not need to
be planted and sprouts out by itself. Don&#8217;t cry over spilt milk. You have to
trust that accumulating bit by bit, you gain a lot. No need to work too hard to
find what you want because it won&#8217;t come to you when it is not the right time.
Even if you walk so far as to wear out a pair of iron shoes, if it is not the
time you won&#8217;t find what you are looking for.&nbsp;
When the right time comes, things come to you automatically.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Water hibiscus opens up in the pond.<br />
Bamboo and pine grow in the snow.<br />
When the time comes, the wood will become a
pillar and beams.<br />
Waiting for a fish in the woods, not much
misfortune it seems.<br />
No need to put yourself in danger,<br />
What you want won&#8217;t come sooner.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
When luck is with you, get a huge fortune, get richer.<br />
Goat and Rooster years come out of the dust,
go into water.<br />
Friends who understand you will shoot an
arrow to the sky.<br />
Sit comfortably on the fairy pond and enjoy
a peaceful life.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
In spring two peaches bloom means two
romances, two bonds.<br />
Mandarin
ducks under the moon won&#8217;t stay together for long.<br />
Separation,
another relationship comes along after it ends.<br />
In later
years, enjoy an active life amongst friends.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
In famous garden, flowers will bring fruit that&#8217;s outstanding.<br />
Unripe green and ripe yellow fruits are on
the branches, hanging.<br />
Good situation, nightingales and swallows
are singing.<br />
When swallows are gone with spring, with
autumn geese are coming.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Dragon is flying amidst the thunder in
the heavens.<br />
Dragon&#8217;s
head and Goat&#8217;s horns are times for separation.<br />
Like the
old days, from green mountain to distant lands water flowing through.<br />
After
your dreams, don&#8217;t remember the sound of the cuckoo.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Medicinal Mushrooms Growing on Rocks<br />
</strong>Gold ornaments must be refined.<br />
Medicinal mushrooms upon rocks have strange
roots.<br />
Goose flying alone will not come back.<br />
You should cross the path in the sky.<br />
What about your career in the old days,
where is it now?<br />
The east wind simply blasts it away.<br />
Just look at your back garden to examine
the fruit trees there.<br />
In late years, there will be a cinnamon
tree that gives out good fragrance.</p>
