<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This is a life that is well planned and
full of preparation.&nbsp; You always make an
effort to prepare for future.&nbsp; Whilst you
speak frankly with a kind heart, your character is haughty and you don&#8217;t
believe in making compromises.&nbsp; If you
are blamed for something you haven&#8217;t done, you do not like it. Yet, you will
not take advantage of others.&nbsp; When it
comes to distinguishing between what is right what is wrong you can easily tell
the difference.&nbsp; Since your strengths can
be applied to overcome your weaknesses, it is easy to have accomplishments in
whatever you do. Even so, there is not enough help due to a lack of people
working for you. Your spouse is not able to offer much assistance. Although you
may have a lot of children, do not expect too much of them. Money can be wasted
in seeking an unreal name. Wealth can be generated in a skillful way, but the
money will be gone for no reason. Bubbles on the water surface are just like
elusive flowers, they are not real.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Among the thorns grows a tall, big,
strong tree.<br />
To build
a tower, lay the foundation gradually.<br />
Nothing
gained in ten years, didn&#8217;t work out right.<br />
It&#8217;s
time to go home whilst the moon is still bright.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
To seek precious friends there is no need,<br />
Good company comes to work with you
naturally.<br />
Scent of the plum blossom at night most
enjoyable,<br />
With a few bosom chums under the moon in
the breeze,<br />
Can talk about anything, it is all so
agreeable.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
In the sand dunes, mandarin ducks share good times together.<br />
Water fowl play among white apple blossom and
red wild flowers.<br />
In the evening, the crows take flight,<br />
You&#8217;re left alone to enjoy your dreams at
night.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Many flowers bloom from the lotus,<br />
Yet,
only one fruit in the rain.<br />
On the
river you row the boat at night,<br />
Hear the
fisherman playing the flute on the riverside.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
With a mind that is always busy,<br />
In Dog and Rooster year, it&#8217;s time to come
out,<br />
Travel ten thousand miles of beautiful
scenery.<br />
Look out over the jade low wall of your
balcony,<br />
Enjoy retirement in a home of beauty and
luxury.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Breaking Stone to Find Jade<br />
</strong>You hammer on a piece of rock, when it is
broken you see the beautiful of piece jade inside.<br />
It is a very strange sort of jade, it is
like a withered pine tree keeping the bamboo company.<br />
Wild goose flies alone.<br />
Water fowls standing on one foot in the
sand.<br />
Everywhere there are spring flowers, yet in
your garden there are autumn chrysanthemums.<br />
What will happen when you leave this
world?&nbsp; You have a son-in-law and a
grandchild around.</p>
