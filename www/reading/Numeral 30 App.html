<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>In this life you have to go through a storm
of wind and waves, ford the river and go through the mountain. Generous and true
to yourself, you know how to enjoy life and you know how to go about getting
things done. Yours is a straightforward character that is quite frank.&nbsp; Because of your nature may have to experience
a loss of money from doing what is right.&nbsp;
You do the right thing but it leads to the wrong result. Therefore, beware
of attracting lawsuits. Your adopted son is really like a son to you. Siblings
treat you as a stranger, your friends know you best.&nbsp; If you really want everything you have to distinguish
the snake from the dragon. You need to know how to spot virtuous people and how
to spot the ignoble ones.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Don&#8217;t expend extra energy to climb a high mountain.<br />
The old
trees with very deep roots reach upwards to heaven.<br />
Ox and Dog
years bring special celebrations.<br />
Someone
by the waterside or with a water connection,<br />
Helps you
establish a family and gain a fortune.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
If your heart is merciful, in the end you&#8217;ll be peaceful.<br />
When the wind dies down, get your fishing
rod ready.<br />
Establish yourself by leaving for overseas,<br />
Where you can catch a big fish alone with
ease.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Romance will not blossom with the boy or girl next door.<br />
A
thousand miles away the moon is bright.<br />
Go far
from home to meet the one who&#8217;s right.<br />
Say no to wild romances or empty flings for
a night.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Flowers outside the wall have all withered,<br />
Leaving
only one fruit that is half green, half yellow.<br />
Among brothers
from all the four seas and five lakes, a good fellow<br />
Who
appreciates coming to the jade hall, offers you a son, for adoption.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
When you meet Rabbit or Rooster it won&#8217;t be too unlucky,<br />
When you
ride the Dragon or Horse there is worry.<br />
Prepare
to adapt to changes with people and industry,<br />
The road
is bumpy, there will be some difficulty</p>

Wild Goose Soaring in the Sky<br />
</strong>You get rich not because of your ancestors.<br />
Your success does not depend on your
relatives.<br />
You will get beautiful jade from digging the
mountain.<br />
You will get a lot of gold from plowing the
field.<br />
With children there are feelings of
kindness and complaint.<br />
With your spouse you do not share the same
philosophy.<br />
When you have fame you attract ten thousand
admirers.<br />
And you will meet bosom friends a thousand
miles away.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You have a lot going on in your life. The secret to your success is to become skilled at judging of people’s characters.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You do not need to try too hard to reach your goals (“Don’t expend extra energy to climb a high mountain”). Think about progressing gradually (“The old trees with very deep roots reach upwards to heaven”). You can meet a person who turns out to be important in your personal life or your professional by the waterside. This encounter does not necessarily need to be located by the waterside, as there can be some sort of metaphorical connection with water. For instance, the name of the place where you meet might have something to do with water.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “When the wind dies down, get your fishing rod ready” implies that when life is calm that is the time to get ready to move abroad. “Where you can catch a big fish alone with ease” suggests that you can be successful due to your own efforts.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “A thousand miles away the moon is bright,” suggests that you can find a good marriage a long way from your hometown.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Flowers outside the wall have withered” suggests that you may encounter difficulties when it comes to having children. “Leaving only one fruit that is half green, half yellow” implies that you will eventually have one son. “Among brothers from all the four seas and five lakes, a good fellow who appreciates coming to the jade hall, offers you a son for adoption” means someone who holds you in high esteem can help you with adopting a son. For followers, you can eventually have reliable followers. Others will recommend you to new followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You need to be cautious during Rabbit or Rooster years and especially careful of your luck during Dragon or Horse years. There could be disruption due to changes and you need to re-adjust.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    All you have to do is work hard to succeed (“You will get beautiful jade from digging the mountain. You will get a lot of gold from plowing the field”). You can attract a lot of fans. “And you will meet bosom friends a thousand miles away” suggests that you can make some good friends with people you meet in a faraway land.
