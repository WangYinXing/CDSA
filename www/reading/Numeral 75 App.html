<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life has firm power, a stiff power.
You are a character with a lot of guts and great ambition.&nbsp; Capable of a lot of good planning, you are
alert to changes.&nbsp; Competent people will
admire you. Ignoble people will hate you.&nbsp;
Whatever you do, be careful of attack that hurts you, but don&#8217;t worry you
will recover later.&nbsp; It is unwise to be
generous to people who will hate you or complain about you in the end. Fame and
fortune comes with a lot of hard work. But when you are old, you can recollect
the good old days.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Like
pine and cedar from the wild grass rising,<br />
Re-shape
yourself with great ambition, wild grass re-shaping.<br />
Support
from rainwater, into the clear river it is flowing.<br />
Eventually,
your good name will be left on the rocks therein.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
South mountains are green, north mountains
are blue.<br />
Opportunities everywhere, friends talk
business with you.<br />
Nothing happens until find a great leader
as a certainty.<br />
Within your office he gives you the seal of
authority.<br />
One morning you cannot believe that it is
for real,<br />
The soldiers will follow the one who holds
the seal.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Mandarin ducks in the river full of
fish in the beginning.<br />
When
winds blow strong, even the pond has big waves attacking.<br />
Scatter
to different countries, where there&#8217;s water for swimming.<br />
Find
another love later and to the fisherman&#8217;s song you&#8217;re listening.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Peach and plum are in competition.<br />
Also there is
cinnamon most fragrant.<br />
Dragon, Tiger,
Goat, Monkey years most lucky,<br />
Children and grandchildren are plenty.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
When riding a horse to come home, unexpected, shocking events, truly.<br />
By the riverside, what is it that&#8217;s there?
It is the star of calamity.<br />
If you foretell the future, it&#8217;s better to
go into the mountains early.<br />
You can still build the pavilion by the
stream.<br />
Always springtime, means many good times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Cloud and Fog over the Mountain Range<br />
</strong>The clouds and the fog are deep in the
mountain.<br />
When you are holding the spear riding a
horse alone, don&#8217;t think of going back.<br />
When you can defeat a million, losing only
three thousand on your side,<br />
You can return home wearing purple and a
golden belt.<br />
When you dig into the rocks you can find
jade.<br />
When you plant flowers, they will become a
forest.<br />
In the battlefield there will be somebody
pulling your hind legs.<br />
When right time comes you will get someone who
knows you well and fights with you.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “This life has firm power, a stiff power” implies that you are courageous and determined. It would be a good idea to pay attention to how others behave towards you.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You have the determination and ability to be what you want to be (“re-shaping”). You can get help to succeed (“support from rainwater, into the clear river it is flowing”). A long-lasting reputation is predicted (“good name will be left on rocks”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “South mountains are green, north mountains are blue” means there are plenty of opportunities. When a leader puts you in a powerful position, the workers (“soldiers”) will follow your orders.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    Although there could be a happy start, a relationship might not survive difficult times (“winds blow strong”). You might end up separating (“scatter to different countries”). However, you can find another relationship and enjoy good times (“fisherman’s song you’re listening”).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Peach and plum are in competition, also there is cinnamon most fragrant,” implies you have many children and grandchildren.  For followers, you can attract a lot of them.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can avoid problems (“star of calamity”) by taking early retirement (“go into the mountains”). To “build the pavilion by the stream” suggests that you can build a magnificent home where you can enjoy yourself.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The clouds and the fog are deep in the mountain,” implies that you face many challenges. When you are ready to fight for your cause, be persistent (“holding the spear riding a horse alone, don’t think of going back”). When you can claim a victory, you can return home and get the accolades (“wearing purple and a golden belt”). At some point you strike good luck (“dig into the rocks you can find jade”). You can expect to reap good rewards (“When you plant flowers, they will become a forest”). Watch out for those who are hindering you and holding you back (“in the battlefield there will be somebody pulling our hind legs”).
