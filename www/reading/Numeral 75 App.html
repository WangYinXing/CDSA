<p><strong>Destiny<br />
</strong>This life has firm power, a stiff power.
You are a character with a lot of guts and great ambition.&nbsp; Capable of a lot of good planning, you are
alert to changes.&nbsp; Competent people will
admire you. Ignoble people will hate you.&nbsp;
Whatever you do, be careful of attack that hurts you, but don&#8217;t worry you
will recover later.&nbsp; It is unwise to be
generous to people who will hate you or complain about you in the end. Fame and
fortune comes with a lot of hard work. But when you are old, you can recollect
the good old days.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Like
pine and cedar from the wild grass rising,<br />
Re-shape
yourself with great ambition, wild grass re-shaping.<br />
Support
from rainwater, into the clear river it is flowing.<br />
Eventually,
your good name will be left on the rocks therein.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
South mountains are green, north mountains
are blue.<br />
Opportunities everywhere, friends talk
business with you.<br />
Nothing happens until find a great leader
as a certainty.<br />
Within your office he gives you the seal of
authority.<br />
One morning you cannot believe that it is
for real,<br />
The soldiers will follow the one who holds
the seal.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Mandarin ducks in the river full of
fish in the beginning.<br />
When
winds blow strong, even the pond has big waves attacking.<br />
Scatter
to different countries, where there&#8217;s water for swimming.<br />
Find
another love later and to the fisherman&#8217;s song you&#8217;re listening.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Peach and plum are in competition.<br />
Also there is
cinnamon most fragrant.<br />
Dragon, Tiger,
Goat, Monkey years most lucky,<br />
Children and grandchildren are plenty.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
When riding a horse to come home, unexpected, shocking events, truly.<br />
By the riverside, what is it that&#8217;s there?
It is the star of calamity.<br />
If you foretell the future, it&#8217;s better to
go into the mountains early.<br />
You can still build the pavilion by the
stream.<br />
Always springtime, means many good times.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Cloud and Fog over the Mountain Range<br />
</strong>The clouds and the fog are deep in the
mountain.<br />
When you are holding the spear riding a
horse alone, don&#8217;t think of going back.<br />
When you can defeat a million, losing only
three thousand on your side,<br />
You can return home wearing purple and a
golden belt.<br />
When you dig into the rocks you can find
jade.<br />
When you plant flowers, they will become a
forest.<br />
In the battlefield there will be somebody
pulling your hind legs.<br />
When right time comes you will get someone who
knows you well and fights with you.&nbsp;</p>
