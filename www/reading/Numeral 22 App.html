<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>Everyone admires your life which appears to
have the brilliance of a diamond, in the olden days it would have been
described as like lustrous jade and shiny gold. Like the three legged urn,
which is full of potential, you are someone of great ability. Like the pillar
and beams that support a building, you are someone capable of holding your own.
You are a child prodigy, whose gifts are less noticeable when you get older. Good
things come meandering into your life; they don&#8217;t come in a straightforward
fashion. Whenever there is something wrong, something that needs changes, you
can waste a lot of time. Despite making a lot of effort the gains do not
measure up, you work hard, but do not build anything that is solid and
practical.&nbsp; Alas, the good things do not
come in full, like beautiful clouds they are easily dispersed, like fragile, colorful
glassware they are easily broken. When you are young, you have great ambition
and can show you are clearly talented. Unfortunately, luck is not with you when
you are in your early years. When you start out you are as proud as the dragon,
yet the dragon changes to a leopard, you have to accept changes.</p>
<p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
The capital city is beautiful in spring,<br />
In your
youth, you are held in high esteem.<br />
To go to
the phoenix pond is right, it seems.<br />
Even if you don&#8217;t get to wear a belt of
gold,<br />
Many good things are coming, for you to
behold.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
You visit
beautiful places as you travel,<br />
Yet, it&#8217;s
not as good as shooting an arrow.<br />
In the
end you will be honored with the flying horse,<br />
Wherever
you go, you can have achievement, of course.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Like a crane
on three islands, you are hard to get,<br />
With
tiger and dragon being on guard,<br />
Finding
a compatible spouse is quite hard.<br />
Unlike
the mandarin ducks that settle down,<br />
You flirt
with the seagulls all over town.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Two flowers means two daughters, a
fruit one son.<br />
Early on you plant bamboo on dry land.<br />
Among the rocks, a beautiful orchid
sprouts,<br />
A wonderful fragrance, it sends out.<br />
You encourage your son, but a daughter has
more clout</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Dog years, if you get drunk be most
careful.<br />
Rooster crows facing water, means
consequences awful.<br />
All the time, reflect on your dreams that
came early.<br />
Don&#8217;t take the first opportunity, examine
every possibility.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Two Birds Sleeping in the Deep Forest<br />
</strong>The bird
wakes up and leaves the forest, the timing is not right.<br />
Remove
the dust on the ladder before you can walk up the ladder to heaven.<br />
Wild
geese flying in formation over autumn waters leave the northern territories.<br />
They make
an abode in the deep forest on a very secure branch.<br />
Don&#8217;t
forget the creator who made this world.<br />
You
don&#8217;t have to worry, everything will come right.<br />
If you
want to know which direction to go to make a good living, the wind brings the
fragrance of the flowers to give you the guidance.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    When you are young, your talents are already apparent. When you encounter changing circumstances, it would benefit you to accept changes.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The capital city is beautiful in spring” alludes to you having achievement when you are young. You are able to reach high places (“phoenix pond”), even if you do not amass great wealth (“wear a belt of gold”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Shooting an arrow” means to aim high, to have big ambitions. To be “honored with a flying horse” implies that you will gain an award of some sort for your achievements.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Like a crane on three islands, you are hard to get, with tiger and dragon being on guard” suggests that you act uninterested, and tend to be apprehensive when someone shows a romantic interest in you. To “flirt with the seagulls all over town” suggests that you can enjoy the single life until you find your match.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can have two daughters and one son. Even though you give your son plenty of encouragement (“plant bamboo on dry land”), it is your daughter who has accomplishment (“among the rocks, a beautiful orchid sprouts”). For followers, your female followers will have greater achievement than your male followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Rooster crows facing water, means consequences awful” suggests that there could be unpleasant outcomes if you get drunk during Dog years.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Remove the dust on the ladder before you can walk up the ladder to heaven,” implies that you have to deal with practical matters before you can climb to success. You can make changes and find yourself in a safe place (“Wild geese flying in formation over autumn waters leave the northern territories. They make an abode in the deep forest on a very secure branch”). “The wind brings the fragrance of the flowers to give you guidance” suggests that you can follow your nose.
