<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>You are very thoughtful and wise. With
cleverness you are capable of making good plans, yet on the other hand you can
be cunning and suspicious. Management skills and the ability to hold power
feature strongly in your life. Fate says there are no sons for you, but you are
destined to have a good spouse. The three penalties and seven killings affect
your life. Therefore, be careful of injuries caused by accidents.&nbsp; You need to go out to earn money in order to
save and accumulate. Wealth and fame can be kept to be developed at home, all
because you are charitable day and night. Everywhere you are carrying out acts
of charity. When you are doing well, know when to stop, for then you will be
able to avoid losses.&nbsp; If you ask how your
relatives and siblings are doing, they have their own lives.</p>
<p><br />

<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Leave
the hustle and bustle of this world behind.<br />
Great
ambitions to do big things, soar up in the sky.<br />
Alas, right
now, wings are not strong enough to fly.<br />
Accumulate
good deeds, and eventually<br />
Meet a
like-mind for a business partner,<br />
Work to
reach the land of success together.</p>
<p>Life Path:&nbsp;<br />
Meet dangerous waves at night on your boat.<br />
At the start of Goat year you can stay
afloat.<br />
Find a safe place by the riverside, moor
securely,<br />
Enjoy the bright moon under a tree of mulberry.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Flowers and trees possess different
beauty.<br />
Marry
someone from another country.<br />
Swallow
flying, day and night nightingale dancing.<br />
Strong
gusts and heavy rain at window howling.<br />
Dim moon,
in the mountains hear cuckoo singing.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Three fruits on the branch means three sons.<br />
Two fruits wither,
mourn sons when you&#8217;re old.<br />
In Dog and Goat
years after sad news, happy tidings told.<br />
Like the dragon
and phoenix dancing alone.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Rooster is telling the time, when moon is just setting.<br />
End of Rat year, start of Ox, events quite shocking.<br />
What is supposed to have withered, blossoms
beautifully again.<br />
Dream a dream once more, to enjoy the
beauty of it all.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Trees Side by Side in Spring<br />
</strong>When the sun climbs on the mountain, snow
begins to melt.<br />
Who is grafting on new branches?<br />
Fame and fortune should have a foundation.<br />
Success or failure is all because of your
destiny.<br />
Mandarin ducks pair up in the water.<br />
As the wild goose flies, it misses the
flock in the sky.<br />
The flowers blossom in the third month of
spring.<br />
The only worry is one night of dusty winds
to blow it all over.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You have executive skills and you can take power. Being charitable generates good karma for acquiring fame and fortune.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    Although you are motivated to fulfil your dreams, it takes time to accomplish your goals. You can improve your luck by doing charitable acts. In time you will meet a business partner and build a successful enterprise.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    To “meet dangerous waves at night on your boat” means that you encounter challenges with your business, yet luck will be with you in a Goat year. Once your business is stable, it will turn out to be successful.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Swallow flying, day and night nightingale dancing” suggests that there is a happy relationship. “Strong gusts and heavy rain at window howling” means that external circumstances bring difficulties for your relationship. You need to be aware that there are unfortunate times (“dim moon”), as well as good times.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    Not all your sons will be around to keep you company in your later years. There is a wonderful celebration (“Dragon and phoenix dancing alone”) in your household in a Dog year or a Goat year. For followers, you will have some loyal followers, but not all of them will stay with you.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Rooster is telling the time, when moon is just setting,” refers to new beginnings, because the rooster is announcing the dawn. “What is supposed to have withered, blossoms beautifully again,” suggests that there is a revival of something, which had appeared doubtful.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Snow begins to melt” alludes to a short-lived success. “Who is grafting on new branches?” suggests that new life can be brought to an established enterprise, like grafting on new branches to an old tree. You can find a happy couple relationship (“mandarin ducks pair up”). You go your own way on your travels (“wild goose flies, it misses the flock”). The third month of spring is at the end of the season, therefore, you enjoy good times (“flowers blossom”) when you are young (springtime). There is no need to worry about your luck changing suddenly (“One night of dusty winds to blow it all over”).
