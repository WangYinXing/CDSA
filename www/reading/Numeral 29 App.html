<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>The nature of this life is you are enthusiastic
in whatever you do. You already have a good career, but you want to make a change
and the change is not for the better. Fame and fortune are so near, yet so far.
You want to do things and you do not want to do them. Your good friends
eventually become your enemies. There is failure hidden in success. You wish to
hold opportunity in your hand, but you have missed out. No matter how you plan,
luck is not with you. It is like sailing a boat against a gust of wind or it is
like trying to get the stubborn and disobedient donkey to grind the millstone.
You do not need to worry about cold weather or times when there is not enough
food.&nbsp; You need to wait for the red faced
nobleman star. Your laughter is half-hearted. If you want be successful away
from your hometown, you have to be careful of the downfall of inherited
business. In your late years you will be happy and can live an easy life
because wind and frost came early in your life.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are keen to make things happen, however before making changes, you need to question if you will really be improving the situation. When luck is not with you, not much progress can be expected (like trying to get the stubborn and disobedient donkey to grind the millstone”). To “wait for the red-faced nobleman star” could mean waiting until the right time, or it could mean that there is someone with a rosy complexion coming to help. “Wind and frost came early in your life” implies that you faced difficulties when you were young, with all the challenges behind you, in later years you can enjoy life.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    If you inherit a family business it will be difficult to keep it going. There might be better rewards (“fishes”) for you if you take an opportunity to travel abroad.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    Your academic achievements help you climb the career ladder (“holding the horn of the ox you climb the ladder to heaven”). Chinese people believe that if you do charitable deeds, it improves your luck. “Accumulate good deeds for fame with fortune” suggest that the “two lucky blessings” of fame and fortune can come about more quickly because of altruistic acts.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Moon comes out from behind the clouds at night” suggests that marriage is wonderful in the beginning. “Sun sets over the mountain, everything is quiet” implies that the relationship fades. “Crane is calling, to wake you up from your dreams. With the wind and the rain you cannot sleep” is conjuring up images of restlessness because your spouse has disappeared without warning.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Many flowers in the wind” can mean many daughters who move away, or it can also mean it may take time for you to have children. A “fruit” means a son. Your charitable acts create good karma, therefore, when you turn old, you can enjoy a good relationship with your son. 
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are likely to retire in Tiger, Monkey, Rat or Horse year. A quiet and affluent retirement is predicted.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Willow blossoms are dancing freely” implies that there are lots of changes in the air. “Pine in the cold is accompanied by the bamboo” suggests that you can withstand difficulties, then make progress. A couple playing music together is symbolic of a happy marriage. “Play the chords on a musical instrument, playing a different melody in the wind” means when your spouse has gone you will find another relationship, a different sort of relationship. “Look at the beautiful peach blossom, while it is blossoming the leaves are green again,” suggests that there is a new romance.
