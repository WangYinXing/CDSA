<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>The nature of this life is you are enthusiastic
in whatever you do. You already have a good career, but you want to make a change
and the change is not for the better. Fame and fortune are so near, yet so far.
You want to do things and you do not want to do them. Your good friends
eventually become your enemies. There is failure hidden in success. You wish to
hold opportunity in your hand, but you have missed out. No matter how you plan,
luck is not with you. It is like sailing a boat against a gust of wind or it is
like trying to get the stubborn and disobedient donkey to grind the millstone.
You do not need to worry about cold weather or times when there is not enough
food.&nbsp; You need to wait for the red faced
nobleman star. Your laughter is half-hearted. If you want be successful away
from your hometown, you have to be careful of the downfall of inherited
business. In your late years you will be happy and can live an easy life
because wind and frost came early in your life.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Inherited business brings many worries,<br />
It is
not worth a lot, whatever it may be.<br />
If you
have an opportunity to go overseas,<br />
It is
good to set sail to catch fishes.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
To celebrate academic success, a banquet invitation.<br />
Holding the horn of the ox you climb the
ladder to heaven.<br />
Heaven sends you two lucky blessings,<br />
Accumulate good deeds for fame with fortune.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
The moon comes out from behind the clouds at night.<br />
Sun sets over the mountain, everything is
quiet.<br />
Crane is calling, to wake you up from your
dreams.<br />
With the wind and the rain, you cannot
sleep.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Many flowers in the wind,<br />
One
fruit, so there is a son.<br />
Do more
good deeds, your son you&#8217;ll teach.<br />
Making
you happy, when old age you reach.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
A prosperous retirement for you to enjoy.<br />
In years of Tiger, Monkey, Rat or Horse,
take a rest.<br />
Retire to the suburbs where you find peace,<br />
With monkeys and cranes for company.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Pine Standing in the Mountain in the Cold<br />
</strong>Willow blossoms are dancing freely.<br />
Pine in the cold is accompanied by the
bamboo.<br />
You can make your living after many changes.<br />
The relationship with your folks will not
be smooth.<br />
Play the chords on a musical instrument, playing
a different melody in the wind.<br />
Look at the beautiful peach blossom, while
it is blossoming the leaves are green again.</p>
