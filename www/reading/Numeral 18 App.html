<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>
In this life you have your ways and your
plans. As a broad-minded character, you know what to look for and you know to
look far. Encountering a lot of difficulties, you have to go through snow and
frost, yet you come out of it fine. When you come across a noble person, do not
expect much support. Relatives cannot help much. You start a lot more projects
than you finish. It is better for you to marry a cousin. When your son marries,
he is wrapped up in his new life, instead of gaining a daughter, you lose a
son. It is better for you to be creative and not so conservative in your
approach to doing things. The relationship with your siblings is not that
great. You lose your parents quite early. Because you speak up all the time, it
will offend people who will attack you due to jealousy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
You want to pass exams, to have
recognition.<br />
But in
Snake or Dog years, you&#8217;ll be unlucky.<br />
When twice
you overcome difficulties,<br />
Then you
will taste the sweetness of success.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
The crops will grow by themselves in
the field.<br />
You will
have success and be outstanding.<br />
If you
try hard to conquer the double mountain,<br />
Wealth and
good standing will be waiting.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
When the phoenix calls, the goose
flies away.<br />
When a
pair flies together, cold fog rises from the waves.<br />
By the
house in the west, flowers fall in the wind and rain.<br />
A good, late
marriage will be obtained.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Like a bear hunting away from home,<br />
Work
hard to raise your children, but you are not close.<br />
Fortunately,
you have a son so successful, he wears red robes.<br />
Moon
shines over the mulberry tree full of the scent of flowers.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
How many times in your lifetime can
you be really happy?<br />
What is
the answer, you do not know.<br />
Reminisce
about the happy times,<br />
Looking
out of south facing window.<br />
When the
Rooster crows it is time to go.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Pearl at the Bottom of the Sea<br />
</strong>When you take life too seriously, you hurt
yourself.<br />
Solitary goose flying in the wind is very
lonesome.<br />
Pair of mandarin ducks playing in the
water, enjoy being in nature.<br />
In the old house you are not so
comfortable.<br />
There are good things to eat when you have
money.<br />
What kind of things can you be proud of in
your life? A pair of good fruits on the tree.<br />
There will be lots of tricky traps on your
path of life.<br />
Whatever you dream about cannot give you
real satisfaction.<br />
After you have brought up your children you
can benefit from children&#8217;s success.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    To go through “snow and frost” means you have the ability to deal with adversity. You can have more achievement if you are self-reliant, innovative and persist with your goals.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    Accept that there are times (especially in Snake or Dog years) when luck is not with you, and encourage yourself to try again.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    Once you have put in the effort you can reap the rewards (“crops will grow by themselves in the field”). If you are willing to face challenges (“climb to the top of the mountain”) you can have accomplishment.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “When the phoenix calls, the goose flies away” implies that you tend to escape from those who chase you romantically. A phoenix and a goose are not the same type of bird, which suggests that it is not easy for you to find a perfect match and discover true love (“When a pair flies together, cold fog rises from the waves”). When you are ready to settle down, you might feel that many suitable partners are already taken (“By the house in the west, flowers fall in the wind and rain”). However, you can marry late and enjoy a good relationship. 
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Like a bear hunting away from home,” suggests you work hard and as a result, you are apart from your children. This indicates you might not be close to your children, yet they can be independent and successful.  To be able to “wear red robes” implies acquiring a high social status. “Moon shines over mulberry tree full of the scent of flowers”, means your children can be wealthy and powerful. Your followers will have achievement in their own right.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    The south-facing window is the sunny window. “Looking out of the south facing window,” means it is a good idea to look on the bright side of life. “When the Rooster crows it is time go,” suggests that you accept that life is full of new beginnings, and to let go of the old.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Solitary goose flying in the wind is very lonesome” suggests that you have fight some battles on your own. “Pair of mandarin ducks playing in the water, enjoy being in nature” implies that you can enjoy married life. “A pair of good fruits on the tree,” means you can have outstanding children (or followers) and be proud of their accomplishments.
