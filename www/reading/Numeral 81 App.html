<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This life is blessed with the ability to
think and plan, and, you are well versed in the application of such skills. You
can plan for wealth without loss of fame because you are very patient with a
determined mind. &nbsp;With an upright
character, there is no fear of attack from forces of evil, but you have to be
careful with your own kin folks. Relatives are like strangers by the roadside.
If you leave your hometown for a faraway land, you will feel full of energy
even though you may be tired.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Because it is lost, wild goose at the waterside is calling.<br />
Doesn&#8217;t know if north or south the way to
be heading.&nbsp;<br />
At sunset, lonely goose reflects lovely
clouds whilst flying.<br />
At the other end of the clouds, just hear
the crane calling.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Even though there&#8217;s rain in garden, flowers will not bloom until later.<br />
Spring has returned, swallow and
nightingale come back for the flowers.<br />
By the riverside with a tame deer for
company,<br />
Put a hook on the line and start fishing
nicely.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Peach blossom casts a shadow on the water, bright and beautiful.<br />
Mandarin ducks interfere with the serenity
of nature, it&#8217;s not peaceful.<br />
Who knows that after rain and wind, the
moon is not full, flowers wither.<br />
Mandarin ducks betray their vows, turn
their backs, don&#8217;t stay together.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
In the garden, the flower is
beautiful.<br />
Nightingale
calls tenderly, on the willow.<br />
Under
your protection, help children avoid injury,<br />
Don&#8217;t
compete on horseback, or do sports that are risky.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
During the Dog year, no need to be in a hurry.<br />
A powerful person decides all for you
already.<br />
Who says the gentle slope is the long way to
the next level?<br />
Undeterred by wind and rain, firmly on this
path you travel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Pine Trees Growing Taller than the Rest of the Forest<br />
</strong>A tall pine tree grows up and out of the
cold forest in winter.<br />
By the river standing in the cold, but the
cold doesn&#8217;t bother the pine tree.<br />
On the water, a pair of mandarin ducks
showing love and care for each other.<br />
On distant skies the flying geese are
casting shadows on the ground.<br />
The branches with flowers are cut in the
end.<br />
Fame and fortune that you gain is not to
your satisfaction, win some and lose some.<br />
Just wait for Ox and Horse years for whatever
you say there&#8217;ll be hundred people echoing your words, and ten thousand people
admiring you.</p>
