<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>Life is like dry germinating buds waiting
for rain and bare branches waiting for spring. Whilst you are full of good
intentions, things do not always go according to plan and what happens may be
the opposite of what you intended. You help others, but what you get back is
people blaming you and cursing you.&nbsp;
Fortune does not appear when it is supposed to.&nbsp; Friends that you thought were intimate, turn
out to be not really that intimate.&nbsp; When
you are in the city, your heart is at sea. There is a lot on your mind, so many
reasons to worry. You try everything you can, but in the end you do not get
good results. Therefore, avoid exhausting all your resources, and using up all
your energy.&nbsp; Let some things be. If you
want to live with your spouse until you are old, do not be afraid to have a clattering
good row, making a lot of noise to clear the air.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
The jade needs to be finely carved,<br />
Even real gold still needs to be refined.<br />
Other people help you to get to see the emperor.<br />
Taking fairies to paradise, you can be the leader.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
You must know that the arrow is in the
hand of one who travels,<br />
One day,
the chance to ride a dragon to the jade capital.<br />
Fortunately,
you can be blessed by a person most noble.<br />
There&#8217;s
double glory to bring you success so wonderful.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Marriage, marriage, and then again
marriage.<br />
Mandarin ducks in places apart, sleeping.<br />
Even though there&#8217;s sweet breeze and bright
moon,<br />
You are all alone, playing music and drinking.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Late spring, branches have good
flowers blossoming.<br />
In
autumn there is one fruit hanging.<br />
On the
high terrace you want to receive good tidings.<br />
Instead you hear the time teller at night, each
hour announcing.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Year of Horse or Rabbit success is reached.<br />
To go
back to the mountains is your destiny.<br />
Looking
back in the old garden to see plum and peach,<br />
Lots of
guests in carriages make your home lively.</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Style:
Leading a Lone Army to the Outpost<br />
</strong>The lone
army is stationed at the outpost.<br />
You are exhausted but the war is not ready.<br />
Retreating spirit is governing your whole life,
like the cloud overshadowing the moon.<br />
All your relatives are as cold as ice.<br />
You have experience of trying to be
skillful, but it turns out to be clumsy.<br />
You want peace, what you get is something
shocking.<br />
If you want your autumn heart to feel easy,
the Rabbit has to follow the Rooster to see the bright moon again.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You have great expectations, yet it would be appropriate to take a relaxed approach. By accepting that there are some circumstances, which are often beyond your control you will save some of your energy.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You need to improve your skills (“jade needs to be finely carved, even real gold still needs to be refined”). To “get to see the emperor” means you will meet with the top person in an organization, and you get to manage a team (“taking fairies to paradise”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The arrow is in the hand of the one who travels” implies the traveller holds the keys. To “ride a dragon to jade capital” means to travel luxuriously to the headquarters of an organization. You will be looked upon favourably and be highly successful.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    There are enjoyable times (“sweet breeze and bright moon”), yet relationships might not last (“mandarin ducks in places apart, sleeping”).
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    You start to have children when you are young (“late spring”) and the youngest son is born when you are older (“In autumn there is one fruit hanging”). Your children have their own lives and you look forward to hearing from them. For followers, you can gain good followers, yet some of them might be distant.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    You have achievement in a Horse year or Rabbit year. You will return to your hometown (“go back to the mountains”) and you welcome many visitors (“guests in carriages make your home lively”).
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are waiting for action (“war is not ready”). Watch out for setbacks (“Retreating spirit”). Good times come in Rabbit years and Rooster years (“Rabbit has to follow the Rooster to see the bright moon again”).
