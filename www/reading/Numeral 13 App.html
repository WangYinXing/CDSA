<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>A phoenix coming out of a group of chickens, and a
dragon coming out of the snake&#8217;s belly, suggest you come from a modest
background to have accomplishment. Even though you have a lot of good plans, you
can never be really satisfied.&nbsp; You are
quite hesitant over many things.&nbsp; When you
are at your most comfortable, you create hardship for yourself. In a peaceful
situation, you worry about gossip.&nbsp; Even
though you try your best, it is not easy for you to have good results. Flowers
in full bloom hit by the night rain. Bright moon covered by passing clouds.
Beware of unexpected bad luck during fortunate times. You are extravagant and
like to spend money to keep up with others, even if you can barely afford it. If
your house is made of straw, you will buy curtains made of jewels and pearls. You
like to acquire things that look good, even though they might not be a good
match to what you already have. </p>

want.</p>

<p><strong>Style:
Sun and Moon Both Bright<br />
</strong>Your career goes through a winding path.<br />
You waste a lot of money.<br />
When you take risks in business, glory will

In later days, flowers will be blossoming
on your path.<br />
One child will keep you company in old age.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Even though you can rise from a humble background to have achievement, you go through some ups and downs. It would serve you well to be more decisive and to be shrewd about managing your money.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Sun and moon both shine at the same time” can have various meanings. You do not often see the sun and moon both in the sky together, so it can suggests that there is something exceptional about you. When the moon is bright it is auspicious, yet if the sun is shining at the same time then you cannot see the moon quite so well. This suggests that you might not always be aware of your good luck. “To meet the Emperor after imperial exam” means to come top of the class, with Ox years or Dog years being the luckiest timing for academic success. “Flying the flag of success eventually”, means you will have achievement.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>

</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
