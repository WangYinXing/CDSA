<p><strong>Destiny<br />
</strong>A phoenix coming out of a group of chickens, and a
dragon coming out of the snake&#8217;s belly, suggest you come from a modest
background to have accomplishment. Even though you have a lot of good plans, you
can never be really satisfied.&nbsp; You are
quite hesitant over many things.&nbsp; When you
are at your most comfortable, you create hardship for yourself. In a peaceful
situation, you worry about gossip.&nbsp; Even
though you try your best, it is not easy for you to have good results. Flowers
in full bloom hit by the night rain. Bright moon covered by passing clouds.
Beware of unexpected bad luck during fortunate times. You are extravagant and
like to spend money to keep up with others, even if you can barely afford it. If
your house is made of straw, you will buy curtains made of jewels and pearls. You
like to acquire things that look good, even though they might not be a good
match to what you already have. </p>
