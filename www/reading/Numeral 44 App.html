<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>You are born with a character that is very
positive, confident and broad-minded. However, success and failure are
unpredictable, and advance and retreat are uncertain. You are busy with
building a reputation and gaining a good name. All the time you are trying to
make a good profit. You should be more leisurely and pay less attention to
seeking fame and fortune, which is on your mind continually. No wonder you are not
at peace.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
When the
sun has passed its zenith, the moon is fading away.<br />
Who&#8217;s
going to use the old wood to connect to branch that&#8217;s new?<br />
You&#8217;re diligent
and trying to seek new opportunities. &nbsp;<br />
In the
end, there&#8217;s someone who knows about you and welcomes you.</p>
<p>Life Path:&nbsp;<br />
The prosperity, it comes naturally,<br />
Cannot request to fail or to succeed.<br />
Action and stillness are all according to
heaven&#8217;s plans.<br />
In a nearby city you can point to one who
understands.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
On the sand dunes, mandarin ducks, one
pair.<br />
After
night rain, they&#8217;re happy together.<br />
At home,
lots of water birds do gather.<br />
A happy
marriage, long-lasting love there.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
A branch is ready to blossom, a daughter in spring,<br />
A son in autumn,
for that is when fruit is hanging.<br />
On shady side of
wall, plum and peach trees are shining.<br />
Live a leisurely
life with pine and mulberry trees,<br />
And chrysanthemums
to keep you company.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Dog and Pig years, success you&#8217;re enjoying.<br />
Dragon and Tiger years bring events shocking.<br />
When you retire, enjoy, take it easy,<br />
The breeze and the moon are full of beauty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Fairy Peach in Night Rain<br />
</strong>The peach is blossoming on two upright
branches.<br />
The spring wind is blowing and hurting the
young branches.<br />
In autumn, when the moon is shining over
pine tree there is a lonely monkey calling.<br />
In winter, the wild geese fly in pairs.<br />
You have to leave your hometown early and
live with other people.<br />
Your home is anywhere within the five lakes.<br />
A purple robed person will bring you to the
ladder reaching the sky.</p>
