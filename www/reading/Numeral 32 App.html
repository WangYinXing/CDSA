<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This is a life where you can hold a
regulating post because you have a powerful star shining on you. &nbsp;Therefore, being an auditor or some sort of
supervisor where you monitor others is highly suitable. Your outward appearance
is dignified.&nbsp; You possess good planning
skills which can be put to good use.&nbsp;
However, your attitude is such that you always have to win and do not
make a good loser.&nbsp; Such a lot of effort
is put in to what you do, yet it looks easy to outsiders. You feel sorry for
yourself because you feel you lack some technique.&nbsp; Clever people will admire you because they know
you are clever.&nbsp; Small-minded people with
no ability will be jealous of you and turn their noses up at you.&nbsp; When you are busy you try to squeeze in some
time to enjoy a bit of leisure.&nbsp; When you
have time on your hands, you always seek opportunities to take action and make
new movements.&nbsp; You can manage without many
people helping and supporting you, you cope on your own.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Throughout life you are always busy,<br />
Your mind is rarely free from anxiety.<br />
Years of Ox or Dog are most excellent<br />
For a new start, or onward movement.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Such grand ambitions reaching far and wide,<br />
Alas no
result, no matter how hard you try,<br />
Until in
middle age you meet benefactors and prosper.<br />
Out of
the misty land, you&#8217;re riding Dragon and Tiger.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
From a
distance, mandarin ducks float on the pond.<br />
Three
people take a dog up the pavilion.<br />
In later
years, the herons come to look for friends.<br />
Outside the
wall, snow falls yet plum tree blossoms.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Two flowers are very beautiful.<br />
Take care of the flowers to turn out
fruitful.<br />
In evening enjoy mulberry tree with berries
wonderful.<br />
Cinnamon tree in your garden so fragrant,<br />
Means you will have many descendants.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Rooster years will be pleasantly
surprising.<br />
Dog year comes, be wary of something scary.<br />
When you have finished dreaming,<br />
It will be time for another waking.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Moon Coming Out from Behind the Clouds<br />
</strong>When you are successful, you are flying
high.<br />
There you see black clouds disperse to
reveal bright stars.<br />
In your younger years, fame and fortune
will not arrive.<br />
In your later years you will prosper and be
wealthy.<br />
You travel like a wild goose, not sending
many letters back home.<br />
Such a long way from home, you do not know
when you will return.<br />
In the end you wonder who is in charge.<br />
You realize you are in charge and can sail
home with the wind.</p>
