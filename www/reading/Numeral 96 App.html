<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This is the life of a person who is born stubborn
with high ambition. You have a kind heart, yet you are frank in speech.
Suspicion and jealousy are invited into your life because you love to talk
about other people. Whoever meets you will respect you because of your fearless
nature. Whatever you may encounter, you are not afraid to go ahead. You have
authority and can give orders properly. Time and again what begins with love
ends in hate, all because of your enthusiasm.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
If you&#8217;re promoted higher, it gets riskier.<br />
Seeking money becomes tougher.<br />
Ox and Dog years bring great achievement.<br />
By the riverside, a deer you hunt down,<br />
With all the rewards, return to hometown.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
With emptiness in your gut, you&#8217;re seeking
happiness.<br />
Recollecting old days, shirt soaked in
tears of distress.<br />
Someone who can appreciate you is in the
north-west.<br />
No need to search everywhere, it would be
needless.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Mandarin ducks, off to a good start, together flying.<br />
Bad days of wind and rain are not long-lasting.<br />
In later years, friends&#8217; company you&#8217;ll be
keeping.<br />
All over willow forest cinnamon scent is
seeping.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Blossoming flowers meet rain and
drizzle.<br />
Two
fairy peaches, half green, half yellow.<br />
For good
fruits do many good deeds for charity.<br />
With
fragrant late plum blossom be happy.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
For going home, a lack of opportunity,<br />
A timetable for returning is unlikely.<br />
Want to meet old friends all over the
streams and mountains.<br />
On a fisherman&#8217;s boat you hear monkeys and
cranes singing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Pine Tree Standing Proudly in the Snow<br />
</strong>Tall tree is used to the cold snow and
frost.<br />
The tree is full of integrity in its sturdy
joints and with lofty ambition it stays evergreen.<br />
Two geese fly high in the clouds.<br />
Moon is shining brightly on a branch of
flowers, casting a clear and sharp shadow.<br />
Close relatives all like a dream.<br />
Flesh and blood is like the water in the
same well.<br />
The boat is stable only after the winds.<br />
You can sail all the way to the capital.<br />
After stormy days there will be career
success.</p>
