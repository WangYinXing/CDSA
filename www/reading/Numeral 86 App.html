<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>In this life you like to adorn your
appearance and show off. You love to be in good company. With lofty ambitions,
you are very clever. Unselfish in how you do things, your approach is
straight.&nbsp; You do not hide any secrets
and can speak outright from your heart. Unethical people pretend to be sincere
and loving to your face, but they will stab you behind your back. Yet you do
not fear jealousy from such ignoble people. There is rescue in all misfortune
because there are plenty of fortunate gods in this life.&nbsp; There is imperfection in whatever you do.&nbsp; Even when there is a good ending, there can
still be some ugliness in process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Love to help others gain, love to help them succeed.<br />
Everything is done whole-heartedly, yet in
the end it turns gossipy.<br />
Blessed, due to doing many unexposed good
deeds for charity.<br />
Upstanding friends, like green pine and
bamboo, keep you company.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Tiger and Horse years are not easy when you are elderly.<br />
Someone lends you a helping hand to arrive
at the path of celebrity.<br />
Amuse yourself by the autumn river in times
of difficulty.<br />
To succeed, go on a chariot for ten
thousand miles through mulberry trees.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
It is lamentable that mandarin ducks are not playing in the pond.<br />
In autumn, standing on the sand dunes,
stand there lonely.<br />
So you have birds and magpies to keep you
company.<br />
Water plants will be green along the river,
green, green, greenery.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Flowering buds on plum tree blossom
early,<br />
The
flowers, there are four or it could be three.<br />
One branch
remains in the snow with red flowers.<br />
On the west
wall, concubine has good flowers, good fruit.<br />
Recollect
how in the east, main mother, is to be paid tribute.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
With good helping hands, you can turn snake into dragon.<br />
What is supposed to be unsuccessful will
turn out a triumph.<br />
All because of a missed opportunity,<br />
All you can do is listen to the bells when
you are elderly.<br />
If you took the chance, there would be a
late harvest.</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Wild Geese Flying Over a City in the South<br />
</strong>You have to fly over one layer of cloud
after another.<br />
You have to swim over one layer of water
after another.<br />
Fairyland will be there waiting for you.<br />
Wild geese are leaving the marshland in
autumn.<br />
Mandarin ducks are chasing the morning
breeze.<br />
People have left when the moon is giving
out its last glory at dawn.<br />
When the cloud comes to the end of the
path, there is no further path to go.<br />
If you ask me about the future, there are flowers
all over the tree elsewhere.</p>
