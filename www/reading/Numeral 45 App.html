<p><strong>Destiny<br />
</strong>This life is like a plant that germinates
but doesn&#8217;t flower, or if the flowers do blossom there are no fruits. Sometimes
there are a lot of leaves and a lot of flowers. Sometimes there are a lot of
dark clouds without rain. On the outside you are as beautiful as flowers and
leaves.&nbsp;On the inside you have tiger&#8217;s fur with a lambs-wool
lining, tough and tender at the same time. Alas, you only make a paper boxing
champion. You can make thirty cents, but you lose two dollars. In a war you may
kill a million, but you lose three thousand yourself. You are merciful in
rescuing others, but unfortunately what you plan is mostly unsuccessful.
Nevertheless, whatever misfortune you encounter becomes fortunate in the end. What
is fortunate in the beginning will become empty in the end. Don&#8217;t complain
about walking an extra mile because you will leave misfortune behind.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
In the
autumn, wild geese fly in a flock,<br />
Three of
them will leave, they head for the north.<br />
Lone
cloud tries to block broad heavenly path.<br />
One
bright moon shines in all its glory.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Early
success or early failure, don&#8217;t grumble.<br />
In the
end all failures become successful.<br />
Sometimes
you should stand alone on autumn river.<br />
You can
pick the right path, you have control.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
A past life bond means spouse is
pre-destined.<br />
Fall for
one who has faults, but don&#8217;t complain.<br />
Marrying
not for love is ill-omened,<br />
What
follows could be tragic with much pain.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Firstly, flowers on the branch will blossom.<br />
In autumn, fruit
bears you a very good son.<br />
The color of the
fruit is deep yellow.<br />
Whatever
difficulties, your son can handle.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Tiger year or Dragon year take care.<br />
Don&#8217;t catch cold wind and rain, beware.<br />
Blessings from fortunate gods are needed.<br />
Recall the dream in autumn whilst you&#8217;re inebriated.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Standing at the Red Door Alone.<br />
</strong>The wind and the rain are cold and sad.<br />
Lonely wife standing against the red
railings with the door to the balcony half open.<br />
Half-hearted, she wonders about when the
husband will return on horseback.<br />
Life is like an urn with three legs.<br />
Family is like flowers on separate stems.<br />
You have to separate because of your karma,
for the time being.<br />
Don&#8217;t even ask when you will be together,
heaven will not leak its secret to you.</p>
