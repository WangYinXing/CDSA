<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>In this life it is better for you to be
independent than to depend on your ancestors. Relatives turn a cold face towards
you. There is also a lack of brotherly love.&nbsp;
Colleagues do not offer much help. You rely on your own two hands to
make a living. You do things all by yourself and single-handedly build things
up. Fortunately, you are capable of doing many things and are able to think and
ponder about situations. It appears that your plans can satisfy your ambitions,
but resources sometimes flourish and sometimes wither.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Spring and autumn have gone, but matters are not settled.<br />
Look to the future, the cycle of nature to
be followed.<br />
After big changes, there comes opportunity,<br />
When no need to
wait for people to be helpful,<br />
When no need to
work over-diligently.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
When you slip several times, depend on
others to give you a hand.<br />
For good results start a new business, old
ones you must disband.<br />
When looking back, flourishing mulberry
trees you&#8217;ll see.<br />
Good tidings from heaven reach phoenix
pavilion, find success eventually.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Pair of mandarin ducks, swim in clear pond.<br />
With two spouses, you&#8217;ll make more than one
bond.<br />
Fallen petals after spring, many affairs
they bring.<br />
When it&#8217;s over, don&#8217;t stay, lovers simply
fly away.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Flowers blossom, but no fruit, until one comes very late.<br />
This one, most carefully, you cultivate.<br />
If you do good deeds for charity,<br />
Good children around you when you&#8217;re
elderly.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
When you meet the Dog, it&#8217;s a topsy-turvy
year.<br />
From Tiger to Snake, what is most shocking?<br />
In these four years such a lot&#8217;s happening.<br />
It depends on a good doctor to find a cure,<br />
For then you can escape from any danger.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Twin Fish Playing in Water<br />
</strong>You are very ambitious but you have to wait.<br />
Ducks and geese fly in different directions
over the misty water.<br />
In the old garden after the rain at night there
is new grass.<br />
The new tree standing in the spring wind
brings new branches.<br />
From the old days, you have come to know
how good your horse is when the journey is really long.<br />
From now on everything is stable and life
is emerging.<br />
There is someone who can understand and
appreciate your ability, and you can forget about the dark old days.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    It suits you to be self-reliant. You have the wherewithal to reach your goals with whatever you have at your disposal.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Spring and autumn have gone, but matters are not settled,” suggests that you need to persevere to fulfil your ambitions. You will be able to take hold of an opportunity that you can manage by yourself.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    When you encounter setbacks (“slip several times”), you can rely on others to help you. You will be successful in the end.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are likely to have more than one marriage, and many love affairs.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Flowers blossom” suggests daughters, and later on a son (fruit). If you create good karma by being charitable, it helps your children. For followers, you are likely to have more female followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Dog years might turn out to be chaotic. “From Tiger to Snake,” means the four consecutive years of Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon and Snake. If you feel unwell during these years, it’s important to seek medical attention promptly.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Ducks and geese fly in different directions over the misty water,” implies you need to get clear on where you are going. There is hope after overcoming difficulties (“in the old garden after the rain at night there is new grass”). “The new tree standing in the spring wind brings new branches,” suggests that a new venture can develop well. “From the old days, you have come to know how good your horse is when the journey is really long,” means you remain determined and keep going.
