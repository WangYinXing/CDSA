<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>Your birth may be seen as an unlucky omen
for your family because it coincides with something untoward happening to your
relatives.&nbsp; You are distant from your
parents and children, so you should leave home and live a life far away. Hence,
you will be leading a solitary life.&nbsp; Even
though you appear to be relaxed, you are in fact highly ambitious with some
huge goals, it is like the sky is the limit. &nbsp;Although you are working hard, sailing the
waves for a thousand miles, you could find yourself performing on the street
corner. Working life starts early, and you retire late. In this life you
encounter a lot of trials and tribulations.&nbsp;
It is even frustrating when you think about things and you cannot make a
decision. There is not much of a bond with your siblings, but you have a good
rapport with friends. Even though climbing the mountain is a laborious task, in
the end there is a time when you can glide along the path with ease. &nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation:&nbsp;<br />
Like bamboo and pine, ambitions rise
above cloud.<br />
Just as Kun,
the fish, transforms into Peng, big bird,<br />
One day you&#8217;ll
grow wings leave water and fly skyward.<br />
Riding a
plane to reach the sky, eventually,<br />
The
Prosperity Horse brings you much glory.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Taking a bow and arrow you can shoot
anytime,<br />
Horse
and Dragon years, up to the sky you climb.<br />
Enjoy
success by purple rose deep in the forest,<br />
Listen
to heavenly melodies from the finest.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
After the wedding, you attract sympathy.<br />
Foundation for relationship is unsteady.<br />
To prevent collecting memories unhappy,<br />
Avoid marrying for social status or money.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
By the wall, plum wants to blossom.<br />
Wind
scatters flowers, a foursome,<br />
Of green
for sons and red for daughters.<br />
In your
back garden a strange fruit, that&#8217;s peculiar,<br />
Like the
heavenly peach, a stepchild who&#8217;s clever.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Bad luck in Geng and Jia years, face restrictions.<br />
No success at these times, get out of
situations.<br />
Retire to the wilderness to find a boat on
the river.<br />
There
the fishermen are singing and you can listen.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Riding a Boat to Ford a River<br />
</strong>In times of danger there is a savior.<br />
You have to work hard.<br />
Wealth is like snow in spring.<br />
Relationships are like dust on country
roads.<br />
The wild goose is flying to leave home,
like the mandarin duck losing its partner.<br />
If you want to know the future, it is like
the plum blossom after the snow.</p>
