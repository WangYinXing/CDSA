<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>You are born with a gutsy, rigid character.
Decisive and able to make your mind up quickly, everything is negotiable with
you.&nbsp; In the time it takes to walk ten
steps you can create nine brilliant ideas. When you end up with time to
yourself, you are obliged to be busy at heart, all because you are frank and
speak your mind.&nbsp; Like a tiger which
creates a safe cave before it ventures out, you should sort out your home first
before you go out into the world. There is no need to complain that your luck
has not come. Wait and it will come. No matter how hard you try to find your
luck, it will not turn up before it is due. You could walk so far that you
would wear out a pair of iron shoes trying to find it. Eventually, luck will
appear in front of you without you making any effort.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
When you&#8217;re born rich you don&#8217;t know about the difficulty in making money.<br />
Month after month, year after year, then
you understand how sad it can be.<br />
Eventually, at
the water concourse you will meet somebody.<br />
Together, by the riverside, get the deer,
because it&#8217;s in your destiny.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
When you decide to establish your career,<br />
Many money making opportunities appear.<br />
You come across someone who&#8217;s most wise.<br />
In a faraway land, meet again renew your
ties,<br />
Reunite for something good, for both of
you.<br />
Finally, by the waterside, your fame shines
through.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
On a beam, swallows build a nest,<br />
It might fall down, be very cautious.<br />
Make a home with a spouse,<br />
Beware to protect your house.<br />
Sunshine and showers, rows then sweetness,<br />
Enjoy the moon on your high terrace.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
The flowers are blossoming in the garden.<br />
Nightingale flies away leaving branches empty,<br />
Find a replacement companion quickly.<br />
To help you raise your family.<br />
So in later years, a son keeps you company.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Goat year, better not travel farther.<br />
In Horse year beware of fire and water.<br />
The god of fortune gives you a blessing,<br />
Always with you for your safe-keeping.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Bright Moon Emerges When the Clouds Disperse<br />
</strong>You try every means you can to run your
business.<br />
When the clouds are dispersed the moon is
bright again.<br />
When the night rain destroys the flowers,
there is one fruit glorifying the branch in the autumn wind.<br />
Wild geese flying in formation, three of
them will lose their way.<br />
The mandarin ducks sleeping together are
careful of being frightened.<br />
Arrow from your bow will follow the Rabbit
and Rat to bring you success at these times.<br />
In Dragon and Horse years you will enjoy
the prime time of your life.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are active and full of ideas. Although you believe in putting in a lot of effort to have achievement (“wear out a pair of iron shoes”), you need to be patient. Luck will arrive when the time is right.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    If you have a comfortable start to life, you might not realise how hard it can be to create wealth. In time, you will meet somebody and succeed (“get the deer”) together. You might meet this person by water, or when you are at some sort of crossroads (“water concourse”) in your life.
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    You might meet up again with a business partner somewhere far from home. You can gain a good reputation for your achievements. You are likely to find success in a location near to water.
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    Protect the home you set up together as a couple. Even though there might be some disagreements in your marriage, you still enjoy many good times together.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    The “flowers are blossoming in your garden” means you have a lot of children. “Nightingale flies away” alludes to your spouse leaving the marriage. You remarry and raise a family together. For followers, you attract a lot of them and there are some particularly loyal ones.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Avoid taking long trips in a Goat year. Be careful of accidents during a Horse year. You are blessed and remain safe when there are unfortunate events.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    As problems go away, hope returns (“when the clouds are dispersed the moon is bright again”). In later years (“autumn”) there will be a filial son (“fruit”) to keep you company. The team or the family might not stay intact (“wild geese flying in formation, three of them lose their way”). You will achieve your goals (hit the target with your arrow) in Rabbit and Rat years.
