<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This is the life of a person who thinks a
lot and is very smart. You can get something unintentionally and create
something from nothing.&nbsp; Those who are
close to you will be like clouds covering the bright moon. Wealth is like
duckweed in the waves, bobbing up and down. Whatever turns out to be
delightful, would have encountered a lot of trying difficulties along the way.
It is easy to lose fame and fortune. Whatever misfortune you encounter can be
cured.&nbsp; There is no danger of facing
lawsuits. It is suitable to leave your family business early and start your own
career.</p>
<p><br />
</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation:<br />
Moon is like
silver in the breezy cloudless sky.<br />
Frosty
red maple leaves moonlit at midnight.<br />
Already
in the palace, your future is bright.<br />
Sound of
drums and bells on lots of occasions,<br />
Promotion
after promotion, many celebrations.</p>
<p>Life Path:&nbsp;<br />
In late years, a lot of reorganization.<br />
Great ambition and hard work gives you
recognition.<br />
Fame in this commercial world brings you
fortune,<br />
But you escape to enjoy life in a distant
mountain.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Marriage pre-destined because of past
life.<br />
Wind
blows away clouds reveals a moon bright.<br />
Pine
tree stands to proudly greet frost and snow.<br />
Feel the
chilly blanket and the cold pillow.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
Tree is full of flowers in blossom.<br />
One fruit means
there is one son.<br />
Mulberry and
cinnamon means lots of grandchildren.<br />
Recount
the tales of your boat journey to them.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Horse or Ox year wind blows clouds away,<br />
Time to go to the mountains they say.<br />
In green mountain cranes and baboons keep
you company.<br />
Lie down and listen when you&#8217;re elderly,<br />
To announcement of winter by the bell
that&#8217;s frosty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Moon Shining Over Quiet Chamber<br />
</strong>The moon is bright like an icy wheel.<br />
Staying out of this world doesn&#8217;t carry a
speck of dust.<br />
All the worries do not disturb the
satisfied person.<br />
Living a leisurely life is good for this
person.<br />
When the full moon, also known as jade
rabbit, rises above the sea,<br />
The bright sun, also known as golden crow,
shines through clouds.<br />
Family is over the five lakes.<br />
In spring flowers are gone and the fruits will
ripen.</p>
