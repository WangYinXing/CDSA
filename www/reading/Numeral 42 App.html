<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>In this life fortune comes out of misfortune.
When you are laughing there is worry beneath the laughter. Destiny implies that
you have offended the Retreating Spirit and in whatever you do there is success
and there is failure. Between you and your relatives there is no rectitude.
However, you have very good friends. Heaven bestowed upon you a gift of
cleverness. Even though you have the loyalty to serve your country, you will be
back-stabbed by small-minded people. You serve people with your whole heart, but
only get verbal compliments in return. When you are down there is someone to
help you stand up. When you are rich, beware for there are ghosts that steal
your money. Your spouse has to prepare to sing the widow&#8217;s song and your young
children have to prepare to say farewell to you. Your destiny is full of
misfortune and the family business will decay. It is important for you to abstain
from all kinds of unkind words and deeds.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck
Verses</strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
At first, stay on the hill tops to prepare,<br />
Remove thorns and build a terrace there.<br />
The business you start from scratch, shocks
the world like thunder,<br />
Brings out fairies from caves, attracts
like-minds to work together.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
Beneath worries, happiness is concealed.<br />
Ox and Horse years bring fortune at the
start,<br />
Yet by year&#8217;s end danger will be revealed.<br />
Luckily, bright moon shines over five lakes,<br />
Where, you can still catch fish in clear
waters.</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
In the late
spring rain, peach trees blossoming.<br />
Among willow trees, the old dragon sighing.<br />
No need to buy the cool breeze and bright
moon.<br />
Plum trees are elsewhere, for romance go
there.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
On meeting the Rabbit, Dragon or Horse,<br />
Hear thunder in the heavenly palace.<br />
The orchids are abundant, growing strong,<br />
Meaning many good offspring, quite a
throng,<br />
Cinnamon trees playing in the evening
breeze.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Cast net, holes too wide, fish are
escaping.<br />
Suddenly, a ladder appears, upwards to
success.<br />
Shoulder to shoulder you are walking&nbsp;<br />
With those who have a good understanding.<br />
When the moon rises above the mountain,<br />
That&#8217;s when you will hear the cuckoo
singing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Crane Standing on Pine<br />
</strong>The crane cannot find a place to rest on
the pine.<br />
Throughout the day you stand there without
a word, not feeling happy.<br />
When the wind is strong the branch cannot
be stable.<br />
When waves are attacking your sampan you
have to row very hard.<br />
Wild goose makes melancholy calls to the
west wind.<br />
Mandarin ducks sleep on the bank yet remaining
restless.<br />
Rather pack-up and go into mountains, up into
clouds to live a new life.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    Your luck is such that you encounter setbacks (“offended the Retreating Spirit”). You form stronger bonds with friends than you do with relatives. “Ghosts that steal your money” means that you need to watch out for money being stolen and you might not catch the culprits. The luck for your family business might not last (“family business will decay”). You can improve your luck by creating some good karma (“abstain from all kinds of unkind words and deeds”).
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You can start with nothing and build up a successful business. When people hear about what you are doing, there will be those who come to find you to work with you (“brings out fairies from the caves”).
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    When there are problems, you can find solutions (“Beneath worries, happiness is concealed”). Ox and Horse years look promising at the start, yet you discover some threats to your success. However, you have the good luck (“bright moon shines over five lakes”) to continue to prosper (“still catch fish in clear waters”). 
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “In the late spring rain, peach trees blossoming, among the willow trees, the old dragon sighing” implies that you are watching others fall in love, and yearn to find your soul mate. “No need to buy the cool breeze and bright moon. Plum trees are elsewhere, for romance go there” suggests that there is no need to mope because you can find love somewhere else.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    You are likely to have children in Rabbit, Dragon or Horse years. “Hear thunder in the heavenly palace” suggests that you hear good news (about new babies) all of a sudden. You will have many good children and they will be around you when you are old (“Cinnamon trees playing in the evening breeze”). For followers, you will have a lot of good followers.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Cast net, holes too wide, fish are escaping” suggests you encounter difficulties in doing business. You can get help from understanding business partners (“shoulder to shoulder you are walking”) and quickly solve any problems to become successful (a ladder appears, upwards to success”). Good times are when “the moon rises above the mountain” and you can feel pleased.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The crane cannot find a place to rest on the pine,” suggests you cannot easily find a suitable role where you are. Therefore, you might want to go elsewhere (“when waves are attacking your sampan you have to row very hard”). “Wild goose makes melancholy calls to the west wind. Mandarin ducks sleep on the bank yet remaining restless” implies that if you are unhappy, you might as well leave where you are to make a new start.
