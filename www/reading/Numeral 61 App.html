<p><strong>Destiny:<br />
</strong>This is a life that is full of great plans
and high ambitions. Your character is natural like an undecorated tree, free of
artificial ornaments.&nbsp; In whatever you do
you have a mature approach. Like shallow waters in autumn, your relationship
with your relatives does not run deep. Like cold charcoal in winter, your
relationship with your brothers and sisters lacks warmth. Even though you are
well organized and plan ahead there are still lots of ups and downs. You can waste
time in getting approval. Whenever you do people a favor there is a lack of
kindness in return.&nbsp; Like setting the
house on fire when you burn incense, your good deeds bring you misfortune. It
can happen that there are delays to good things coming your way and
opportunities can be missed and lost. If you want to have your heart&#8217;s content
ride the Horse and Dragon, for in these years your wishes will be fulfilled.</p>

<p><strong>Luck
Verses </strong></p>
<p>Foundation: <br />
Sampan on dry land cannot row anywhere,<br />
So might as well use fishing rod right
here.<br />
Like jade buried in green field for many a
year,<br />
You&#8217;re appreciated when those from afar
appear.<br />
People nearby, those around locally,<br />
Don&#8217;t discover your precious ability.</p>
<p>Life Path:<br />
By chance hit the target with your arrow,<br />
Hit the valuable, golden animal.<br />
All of a sudden, in a strange land, a noble
person you will encounter.<br />
You&#8217;re expected to return to heaven after
your earthly adventure<sup>1</sup><br />
In fairyland heaven, the trees are always
in spring,<br />
It is all magnificent, every single thing. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Marriage:<br />
Orchid on rocks, shallow roots grow not deeply.<br />
Past good deeds keeps orchid anchored
firmly.<br />
Water fowls living in great company.<br />
Moon shining bright makes awesome autumn lights.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
One twig of fabulous flowers outside
the wall,<br />
Unexpectedly,
meets wind and rainfall.<br />
Mandarin
ducks play at water junction of Snake and Dragon.<br />
Flourishing
peaches and plums means many children.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
In Horse or Ox year you can be a military general.<br />
In Dragon or Tiger year go to the mountains
to repose.<br />
In the southern chamber lay on the magical
pillow<br />
To dream amazing dreams, wake up feeling
hollow.<br />
Sound of flying geese is clear and rings
out across the universe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Fishing in Clear Waters<br />
</strong>The ancient deserted house cannot attract
swallows to nest.<br />
Whenever you meet the bridge there is a
road leading to the heaven pavilion.<br />
In Ren Wu year there is fame and fortune.<br />
You have to wait with firmness on the
fishing palace.<br />
Let the tale of chicken ribs be a reminder
for you not to be too clever.<br />
To win a competition is not really a good
thing because over-exposing your talent can bring misfortune.<br />
In the courtyard, if you ask about when the
east wind, which brings good tidings, arrives at your house.<br />
The answer is you have to plant flowers in
a dangerous field, for then it will blossom on the entire tree.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Footnote 1<br />
A Chinese belief is
that fairies who commit misdeeds in heaven receive a penalty of being sent to
earth to live a human life. When they complete their time on earth they can
return to heaven.&nbsp; Life on earth is much
harder than living in heaven, therefore the implication is that the person
works hard.</p>
