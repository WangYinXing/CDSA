<h3>Poetic Life Reading</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny:</p>
<p class="contents">
<p>This life is like the wind and thunder,
there is sound but no form. You want to skillful but you become inelegant. You
want to walk a straight path, yet you have to deviate a bit. You get money like
you get rain during April showers and you spend money like the high tide at
dawn. Whilst you can generate a good income, it also flows out quickly.&nbsp; Although you have a lot of good plans, life
cannot be satisfactory all the time. You work for others but do not have a
bosom friend.&nbsp; Whoever you expect to be
your intimate friend is not really that intimate. Whoever is not supposed to be
your close friend turns out to be very close. To avoid ill-omens, if you are a
man you should marry a woman who is strong and hearty.&nbsp; It is a good omen if your children are
difficult in the beginning and easy in the end.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Luck

<p>Marriage:<br />
It is very difficult to get married
early.<br />
Marriage
depends on finding harmony.<br />
When the
characters of husband and wife do not match, it will be difficult to last.<br />
Enjoy cool
breeze under bright moon with someone who knows you best.<br />
In your
late years sleep alone, hear the bell tolling as you rest.</p>
<p>Children:<br />
One tree has shed its flowers, on another good fruits bearing.<br />
East wind is
taking good care of children, mothers are caring.<br />
For wonderful
jade, a long time you&#8217;re waiting.<br />
Good mulberry
trees, satisfaction they&#8217;re bringing.</p>
<p>Harvest:<br />
Ox and Goat year misfortune comes one after another,<br />
Through Tiger and Rabbit years miserable
times linger.<br />
Even good doctors cannot keep you healthy.<br />
Although moon is bright over pavilion, cannot
appreciate the beauty.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Style:
Wild Geese Flies over High Mountain<br />
</strong>Goose flies over mountain with tired wings.<br />
It is good to follow water fowls to reshape
feathers.<br />
At the beginning of Dog year, rest a bit
again and again.<br />
At end of Rat year everything will be to
your heart&#8217;s content.<br />
All because of meeting a good friend in a
strange land.<br />
You will reach the sky from ground level
because there is a ladder to walk on.<br />
Cuckoo is weeping in the rain.<br />
It won&#8217;t come home unless there are turbulent
waves in the well</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>
<div>
<p class="title">Destiny</p>
<p class="contents">
    “This life is like the wind and thunder, there is sound but no form,” implies that you like talking about your ideas. You also need to take action to make them happen. Quite often, life is not straightforward, yet that is what makes it interesting.
</p>


<p class="title">Luck Verses</p>

<p class="title">Foundation</p>
<p class="contents">
    You create good karma and you are lucky enough to have a good reputation throughout your life. 
</p>

<p class="title">Life Path</p>
<p class="contents">
    “The path will be flat, leading you to glory,” suggests that you do not need to struggle in order to have achievement. People from the south-west help you to succeed (“help bring you to the capital city”).
</p>

<p class="title">Marriage</p>
<p class="contents">
    “Enjoy cool breeze under bright moon with someone who knows you best,” suggests that a happy marriage can be found when you and your spouse understand each other well. “In your late years sleep alone, hear the bell tolling as you rest,” implies that you might outlive your spouse, or that you separate.
</p>

<p class="title">Children (‘Children’ can also mean subordinates or followers)</p>
<p class="contents">
    “For wonderful jade, a long time you’re waiting,” suggests that you need to be patient, for you might need to wait before children are born. You will have good children (“good mulberry trees”). For followers, you can expect good followers to come late.
</p>

<p class="title">Harvest</p>
<p class="contents">
    Take extra care during Ox years and Goat years. Ox, Tiger and Rabbit are consecutive years. To avoid problems in Tiger years and Rabbit years, you need to look after your health in Ox years. You might find yourself in pleasant surroundings (“moon is bright over pavilion”), but you need to be fit and well in order to enjoy life.
</p>


<p class="title">Style</p>
<p class="contents">
    You travel far away (“A goose flies over mountain with tired wings,”) and re-invent yourself (“reshape feathers”). You will get to the top step by step (“reach the sky from ground level because there is a ladder to walk on”). After you succeed a long way from home (“in a strange land”), you are unlikely to return to your hometown (“it won’t come home”).
