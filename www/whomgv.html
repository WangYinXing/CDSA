  <p><strong>Who was Master Ghost Valley?</strong></p>
  <p>The original work
    for "Ghost Valley Art of Life Reading" (鬼谷子算命術 Gui Gu Zi Suan Ming Shu) dates from just after the time of
    Confucius, during the Warring States Period (475BC to 221BC). The manuscript
    was written in verse form in a cryptic style, by an author who was known as
    &#8220;Master Ghost Valley&#8221;. The manuscript was believed to have been lost for many
    years until it was rediscovered. Many scholars examined the text before they
    eventually figured out that the work of Master Ghost Valley was a form of
    astrology. Perhaps, it took many discussions sitting in the garden drinking
    cups of wine under the moonlight before they understood what Master Ghost
    Valley was talking about. It was discovered that stars and numerals formed a
    system of life readings. The stars and numerals could foretell the future.
    Master Ghost Valley&#8217;s system of life reading describes someone&#8217;s destiny in a
    series of cryptic verses. Each person&#8217;s destiny, or life path, is determined by
    a year star, an hour star and a numeral. We have named the system &#8220;Chinese
    Destiny Star Astrology&#8221; because it indicates that a person&#8217;s destiny is tied to
    two stars and a numeral. </p>
  <p>Once people
    understood that Master Ghost Valley was writing about a form of astrology he had
    invented, the "Ghost Valley Art of Life Reading" became a popular
    book and it was revered as ancient Classic of Chinese poetry. Many centuries
    on, the &#8220;Ghost Valley&#8221; book is still found in Chinese language bookstores. Clearly,
    the work of Master Ghost Valley has stood the test of time and we are delighted
    to be able to bring the system to a new audience. Because the book has been
    enduring, it raises the questions of:
  </p>
  <p>Who was the
    enigmatic author of the &#8220;Ghost Valley&#8221; book?</p>
  <p>How did he derive
    the readings for the numerals and the stars?</p>
  <p>How Master Ghost
    Valley developed the system of numerals and stars for life readings remains a
    mystery. If you study all the one hundred life readings, maybe you can figure
    out some of Master Ghost Valley&#8217;s ideas? Will you be the one who can solve the
    mystery of how the Master Ghost Valley formulated his system?</p>
  <p>We do know that
    if we have the date and time of birth we can use the Ghost Valley system to
    find the stars and the numeral for a person and obtain a life reading. Astrology can be considered as a study of
    people&#8217;s personality and luck, determined by when and where they were born. It
    took many debates over many years to understand that the &#8220;Ghost Valley&#8221; book is
    a form of astrology. The debates are not over. The discussions have turned to
    the accuracy of the readings by interpreting the poems for each numeral. You
    might ask:</p>
  <p>How accurately do
    the luck verses for your numeral describe your life? </p>
  <p>What about the
    prophecies given by the hour stars?</p>
  <p>How true is the
    prediction given by your year star?</p>
  <p>In the past, the
    conversations about the content of the &#8220;Ghost Valley&#8221; book flowed with cups of
    wine under the moonlight in the garden. Nowadays, you can get together with
    friends and talk about each of your life readings. Suggest to your friends that
    they download the app too. You can chat about how accurate the Master Ghost
    Valley system is at telling you about your past, present and future. You can
    find some of your own answers. The question that we still need to answer
    is: </p>
  <p>Who was Master
    Ghost Valley?</p>
  <p>The contents of
    this app are a translation from Chinese into English, with interpretation, of
    the life readings contained in the &#8220;Ghost Valley&#8221; book. There is a foreword in
    the Chinese language book "Ghost Valley Art of Life Reading" (鬼谷子算命術 Gui Gu Zi Suan Ming Shu) which gives some clues as to the identity
    of the mysterious Master Ghost Valley. </p>
  <p>This is the
    foreword of the book written by Liu Ji 劉基, better known as 劉伯温 who was the
    adviser to the founder of the Ming Dynasty. He is also the author of the famous
    cryptic "Song of the Toasted Cake 燒餅歌". Here it goes:</p>
  <p><strong>Foreword by Liu Ji ( 1331 &#8211; 1375)</strong></p>
  <p>A life can be
    long or short; a word can have positive or negative effect; fortune and
    misfortune, full and inadequate, growing and declining, all have a fixed
    numeral.</p>
  <p>What is numeral?
    It is one of the six Arts. During the Spring-Autumn Period, Confucius taught
    his disciples the six Arts. Only one of them is expert in numerals. He is Duan
    Mu Zhi 端木子. He can predict the future with
    incredible accuracy. When he was old, he handed down all his art to his beloved
    disciple Wang Xu 王詡. Wang used the
    theory of yin/yang and the five elements to do astrological reading with great
    precision. He then retired and lived as a hermit in the Ghost Valley. He spent
    his time writing books to amuse himself. People called him Master Ghost Valley.</p>
  <p>His words are
    mostly cryptic and for hundreds of years no one could decode his writings. Then
    came into the picture Zhu Ge Liang 諸葛亮 in the
    Era of the Three Kingdoms. He got one book written by Master Ghost Valley. This
    book has the title "Ghost Valley Art of Life Reading". He studied the
    book inside out and got all the secrets. Therefore he was able to predict the
    coexistence of the three kingdoms which was the unchangeable numeral. He then
    assisted Liu Bei 劉備 to fight against
    the State of Wei 魏 joining force with
    the State of Wu吳. He was able to display
    his talents in the well-known story of "Borrowing the East Wind" and
    "Borrowing Arrows". People were amazed at his legend. This is all
    because of the knowledge contained in this book.</p>
  <p>Zhu Ge Liang
    realized that this book was incomprehensible. He therefore wrote footnotes for
    each sentence. My friend "The Iron Hat Taoist Monk" got this book and
    showed me. It was like seeing a bright guiding light in the dark. Therefore I
    take the honor of writing a foreword for this book.</p>
