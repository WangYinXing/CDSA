  <p><strong>Symbolism
    and Historical References </strong></p>
  <p>In the original Chinese text of "Ghost
    Valley Art of Life Reading", a lot of references are made to nature;
    seasons, plants and animals. We have left many of these references in the
    translation to convey the same poetic imagery that is found in the classic
    &#8220;Ghost Valley&#8221;. These references have
    symbolic meanings and are reflective of Chinese culture, philosophy and
    history. In addition, &#8220;Ghost Valley&#8221; was
    written at a time when China was ruled by an emperor and run by officials in
    the civil service. Literature and the art of life reading are subject to the
    influence of the historical context of the time of writing. We will discuss some
    of the modern interpretations of the historical references. </p>
  <p><strong>Seasons
    and Climate</strong></p>
  <p>
  </p>
  The cycle of the seasons is symbolic of the
  cycle of a person&#8217;s life. Spring represents youth, summer represents prime
  years, autumn represents middle age onwards and winter represents the elderly
  years. The twelve animal signs are also
  associated with the seasons:<br />

  <table border="1" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
    <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td><strong>Spring</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Summer</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Autumn</strong></td>
      <td><strong>Winter</strong></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Tiger, Rabbit, Dragon</td>
      <td>Snake, Horse, Goat</td>
      <td>Monkey, Rooster, Dog</td>
      <td>Pig, Rat Ox</td>
    </tr>
    </tbody>
  </table>
  <p>When the animal signs are mentioned, quite
    often it is referring to the year, Tiger year or Horse year for instance. Where it seems obvious that the reference is
    to an animal year, we have included &#8216;year&#8217; in the translation. However, there could be occasions when
    referring to the Horse, what was meant was during the prime years of a person&#8217;s
    life.</p>
  <p>When wind and rain is mentioned, it
    indicates challenges and difficulties.
    On the other hand, the east wind, particularly the east wind in spring
    is auspicious. A cool, refreshing
    breeze, particularly under a bright moon is positive imagery. When rain comes with dew rather than wind
    then it is a promise of good things. Frost and wind can symbolize bleak times,
    but the winter years are the latter years of a long life and longevity is
    highly valued in Chinese culture.</p>
  <p>Luck changes for the better when the clouds
    covering the bright moon are dispersed and blown away. The wind that carries
    the clouds away is favorable. If bright
    moon becomes hidden behind clouds, then expect setbacks during good times.</p>
  <p><strong>Plants</strong></p>
  <p>Throughout the ages, Chinese poetry has
    drawn upon nature for inspiration and &#8220;Ghost Valley&#8221; is no exception. Various
    plants and flowers are used as metaphors throughout the book. </p>
  <p>Beautiful tree blossoms and flowers in full
    bloom generally signify good times. It is not too difficult to work out the
    symbolism of fallen petals after wind and rain and of withered plants. Different plants flourish in different seasons.</p>
  <p>The plum tree blossoms at the end of
    winter, around the time of Chinese new year. Plum blossom is a symbol of
    winter. Since the plum can blossom in winter, it also means it can withstand
    difficulties. In spring the willow tree has leaves and is full of blossom, it
    is at its most beautiful. The willow is a symbol of spring and so is the orchid
    which blooms in spring. Chrysanthemums, sometimes referred to as yellow
    flowers, bloom in autumn and are symbolic of the season.</p>
  <p>Bamboo grows straight and upright, yet it
    is flexible and enduring. Like bamboo, the pine tree is also upright and
    enduring and it can withstand the bitterness of winter and keep its leaves all
    year round. Pine trees are symbolic of self-discipline and determination.
    Bamboo grows most quickly in summer. The hardiness of both pine and bamboo
    suggest something long-lasting and someone with a long life.</p>
  <p>Another symbol of longevity is the peach
    fruit. In the luck verses about children, a wonderful peach means an
    outstanding offspring. Fruits that ripen are healthy children. In ancient
    China, the infant mortality rate was high and it was not uncommon for young
    children to die before they reached adulthood.
    In most modern societies, there is a low infant mortality rate, so we do
    not need to pay too much attention to mentions of unripe fruits in the luck
    verses. For the poems about children,
    fruits can sometimes mean sons and flowers can sometimes mean girls. Children
    can also be represented by the lotus. </p>
  <p>The lotus symbolizes purity because of the
    way it grows beautifully out of the mud.
    The lotus is a symbol of good fortune in Buddhism. Good fortune is also
    represented by the peony, which alludes to wealth and status. Mulberry and
    cinnamon trees suggest affluence because in ancient times these were planted
    after sufficient crops for food could be harvested from the land. Mulberry and cinnamon are also symbolic of a
    happy family and home life, which is very important in Chinese culture. Duckweed, a rootless floating plant,
    symbolizes wandering everywhere without settling down, which would be
    considered inauspicious.</p>
  <p><strong>Animals</strong></p>
  <p>The animals found in &#8220;Destiny Stars&#8221; could
    be living animals, mythological creatures or the twelve animal signs of Chinese
    astrology.</p>
  <p>In Chinese poetry, wild geese are talked
    about a great deal. Wild geese are migratory birds, flying south in autumn and
    north in spring. An immediate connotation of flying wild geese is of travelling
    far away. Geese are powerful creatures,
    flying long distances with loud calls. </p>
  <p>A wild goose soaring high is indicative of
    success, moving up through the sky. A flock of geese flying in formation
    suggests teamwork and togetherness. Like mandarin ducks, geese mate for life. A
    solitary wild goose has lost its life partner or it has become separated from
    the flock flying in formation.</p>
  <p>Mandarin ducks mate for life and are
    symbolic of a long lasting faithful romantic relationship. Throughout the &#8220;Destiny Stars&#8221;, you will find
    mandarin ducks as a metaphor for a couple in the luck verses about
    marriage. The nightingale sings
    beautifully evoking associations with love and romance. Swallows build good nests bringing to mind
    ideas of domestic bliss. Crows and cuckoos are considered inauspicious because
    of the sounds they make. The sound of singing with harmonious music playing is
    symbolic of a happy marriage. One of the couple plays music and the other one
    sings. </p>
  <p>The crane is one of the most auspicious
    symbols for birds for it represents longevity and good fortune. A crane on a
    pine signifies determination. When cranes and monkeys are together it is a
    positive image of a happy retirement. The crane can carry the souls of the
    deceased to heaven, for spirits can ride on cranes. Re-incarnation is a Chinese
    belief, and some of the poems in &#8220;Destiny Stars&#8221; talk about past lives. One
    point of view is that each life is like a dream and when a soul has completed a
    life on earth and returns to heaven, it is like waking up from a dream. Another
    cycle of life starts. Youth and happiness are represented by the cicada, a
    noisy insect. In the insect world, bees
    are hard-working and productive, whilst butterflies enjoy socializing, flying
    about here and there.</p>
  <p>A mythological bird that is able to fly
    great distances is the big bird, Peng. According to legend it is transformed
    from the big fish Kun. Peng and Kun are different forms of the same creature.
    When Kun turns into Peng it is symbolic of a transformation of something that
    can go far.</p>
  <p>The most famous mythological creatures are
    the dragon and the phoenix, both harbingers of good fortune. Together the
    dragon and phoenix symbolize a harmonious relationship between husband (dragon)
    and wife (phoenix). </p>
  <p>The dragon also features in the twelve
    animal signs and it is the only mythological creature out of the twelve. In &#8220;Destiny Stars&#8221;, when we talk about the
    animal signs as time, such as years, we write it as a proper noun, for example,
    year of the Dragon.</p>
  <p><strong>Life
    under the Rule of the Emperors</strong></p>
  <p>The dragon is also a symbol of the emperor,
    the son of heaven, who had power under heaven, on earth. Whilst the emperor was the ruler, the
    administration of the empire of China was carried out by civil service
    officials. There was a system of imperial examination for selecting candidates
    to become part of the bureaucratic system of officials. It was highly desirable to pass the imperial
    examinations and have a career as a government official. In ancient China, there were not many large
    organizations apart from the civil service and the military. However, in most
    modern societies there are large commercial organizations. Any references in &#8220;Destiny Stars&#8221; to being
    near to emperors have the symbolic meaning, in a modern context, of being near
    somebody powerful, for instance the CEO of a large company. References to imperial exams can be taken to
    mean gaining good qualifications. Moving
    through the ranks as an official can be likened to climbing the corporate
    ladder in a major organization.</p>
  <p>Government officials wore special robes
    that were red or purple, that could not be worn by people who were not part of
    the bureaucracy. Often they also wore a
    golden belt. References to being dressed
    in red or purple means succeeding in passing the imperial exams and becoming an
    official. This is symbolic of having a
    successful career in modern life, where there are promotions through the
    organizational hierarchy.</p>
  <p>Families with great wealth would have
    ambitions to have a son who could become a government official. It would be considered a notable success to
    pass the imperial exams and move to the capital. Otherwise, people would tend to stay in their
    hometown to make a living, unless they found that it was very difficult. Sometimes, the husband would leave the rest
    of the family behind as he sought his fortune elsewhere in other lands. Even
    after China was unified, it was really an empire comprised of different
    countries, but all under the rule of the emperor. According to the Destiny Numerals and Stars,
    some people are better off leaving their hometown.</p>
