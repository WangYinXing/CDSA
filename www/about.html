  <p><strong>About the Feng
    Shui Research Center</strong></p>
  <p>Chinese Destiny
    Stars was co-authored by Joseph Yu and Ting-Foon Chik. The Chinese Destiny Stars Astrology App is
    the first foray by the Feng Shui Research Center into the
    world of smartphones and tablets.</p>
  <p>The Feng Shui
    Research Center was founded by Joseph Yu in Toronto, Canada in 1998. The Feng
    Shui Research Center has a global reach of around fifty countries, in many
    languages.</p>
  <p>Ting-Foon Chik is a dedicated student of Master Joseph Yu and is one of the
    official lecturers of the Feng Shui Research Center.</p>
  <p><strong>Joseph Yu B.Sc.</strong></p>
  <p>余若愚</p>
  <p>Joseph Yu was
    born during the second world war in a small village in South China. He spent
    his childhood as a country boy and did not receive any formal education until
    he came to Hong Kong at the age of eleven. A lot of people suggest to him that
    he should create a story of learning Astrology and Feng Shui in early childhood
    from a monk as do many a famous Feng Shui Master. He prefers to tell the truth.</p>
  <p>Yu studied
    Mathematics and Physics in the University of Hong Kong in the early 1960's. He
    abhorred all kinds of superstition and vowed to destroy such absurd beliefs of
    ignorant people. He then frequented libraries, trying to find fault with
    Astrology and Feng Shui from ancient books. The deeper he went into the
    subject, the more excited he became about the rich legacy of ancient Chinese
    culture.</p>
  <p>Whether or not to
    become a professional astrologer and geomancer or continue in the fields of
    mathematics and physics, became a constant dilemma. Astrology and Feng Shui
    have been viewed as superstition by their skeptics. Astrologers and Feng Shui
    masters have been linked with fraud for centuries.</p>
  <p>Someone wrote in
    his book, "If more knowledgeable men provide true Astrology and Feng Shui
    services, the ignorant and fake 'professionals' will vanish." Sharing the
    same view, Yu decided to provide useful services and correspondence courses at
    an affordable price.</p>
  <p>In order for more
    people to understand what Chinese Astrology and Feng Shui really are, Yu is
    offering carefully planned courses. Some of the courses are for the average
    layman; others aim at training people, dedicated to practicing Feng Shui and
    Chinese Astrology consultation. It is hoped that one day this valuable Chinese
    culture earns proper recognition by the scientific world.</p>
  <p>Joseph Yu founded
    the Feng Shui Research Center in 1998 to accomplish his mission.</p>
  <p>While Joseph Yu
    was a mathematics teacher after his graduation, he was lucky to have as his
    neighbor one old Feng Shui master. This old master was very kind to disclose a
    lot of secrets of the five arts to him even though he was not one of the old
    master's apprentices.</p>
  <p>In one Chinese
    New Year party at the old master's home, the master said to his disciples,
    "This young man, though not officially under my care, has learned more
    than most of you because he has a logical mind and dares to argue with me on
    various issues."</p>
  <p>The old master
    passed away a few months later. Joseph Yu did not feel comfortable in the
    company of the disciples of this good master. He is grateful, but circumstances
    make it impossible to express his gratitude towards the master who passed on to
    him a lot of invaluable knowledge.</p>
